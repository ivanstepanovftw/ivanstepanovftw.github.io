\subsection*{Problem 1 (5+5+5 points)}

Suppose that $A(p)$ takes a vector $p\in\R^{n-1}$ and returns
the $n\times n$ tridiagonal real-symmetric matrix
\[
A(p)=\left(\begin{array}{ccccc}
a_{1} & p_{1}\\
p_{1} & a_{2} & p_{2}\\
 & p_{2} & \ddots & \ddots\\
 &  & \ddots & a_{n-1} & p_{n-1}\\
 &  &  & p_{n-1} & a_{n}
\end{array}\right),
\]
where $a\in\R^{n-1}$ is some constant vector. Now, define
a scalar-valued function $f(p)$ by 
\[
f(p)=\left(c^{T}A(p)^{-1}b\right)^{2}
\]
for some constant vectors $b,c\in\R^{n}$ (assuming we choose
$p$ and $a$ so that $A$ is invertible). Note that, in practice
$A(p)^{-1}b$ is \emph{not }computed by explicitly inverting the matrix
$A$---instead, it can be computed in $\Theta(n)$ (i.e., roughly
proportional to $n$) arithmetic operations using Gaussian elimination
that takes advantage of the ``sparsity'' of $A$ (the pattern of
zero entries), a ``tridiagonal solve''.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write down a formula for computing $\partial f/\partial p_{1}$ (in
terms of matrix--vector products and matrix inverses). (Hint: once
you know $df$ in terms of $dA$, you can get $\partial f/\partial p_{1}$
by ``dividing'' both sides by $\partial p_{1}$, so that $dA$ becomes
$\partial A/\partial p_{1}$.)
\\
\\
\textbf{Solution:} From the chain rule and the formula for the differential of a matrix inverse, we have $df = -2(c^T A^{-1} b) c^T A^{-1} dA\,A^{-1} b$ (noting that $c^T A^{-1} b$ is a scalar so we can commute it as needed).  Hence
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial p_1} &= \underbrace{-2(c^T A^{-1} b) c^T A^{-1}}_{v^T} \frac{\partial A}{\partial p_1} \underbrace{A^{-1} b}_x \\
&=  v^T \underbrace{\left(\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 & 1\\
1 & 0 & 0\\
 & 0 & \ddots & \ddots\\
 &  & \ddots & 0 & 0\\
 &  &  & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right)}_{\frac{\partial A}{\partial p_1}} x = \boxed{v_1 x_2 + v_2 x_1} \, ,
\end{align*}
where we have simplified the result in terms of $x$ and $v$ for the next part.

\item Outline a sequence of steps to compute both $f$ and $\nabla f$ (with
respect to $p$) using only \emph{two} tridiagonal solves $x=A^{-1}b$
and an ``adjoint'' solve $v=A^{-1}\text{(something)}$, plus $\Theta(n)$
(i.e., roughly proportional to $n$) additional arithmetic operations.
\\
\\
\textbf{Solution:} Using the notation from the previous part, exploiting the fact that $A^T = A$, we can choose $\boxed{v = A^{-1} [-2(c^T x) c]}$, which is a single tridiagonal solve.  Given $x$ and $v$, the results of our two $\Theta(n)$ tridiagonal solves, we can compute each component of the gradient similar to above by $\boxed{\partial f/\partial p_k = v_k x_{k+1} + v_{k+1} x_k}$ for $k=1,\ldots,n-1$, which costs $\Theta(1)$ arithmetic per $k$ and hence $\Theta(n)$ arithmetic to obtain all of $\nabla f$.

\item Write a program implementing your $\nabla f$ procedure (in Julia,
Python, Matlab, or any language you want) from the previous part.
(You don't need to use a fancy tridiagonal solve if you don't know
how to do this in your language; you can solve $A^{-1}\text{(vector)}$
inefficiently if needed using your favorite matrix libraries.) Implement
a finite-difference test: Choose $a,b,c,p$ at random, and check that
$\nabla f\cdot\delta p\approx f(p+\delta p)-f(p)$ (to a few digits)
for a randomly chosen small $\delta p$.
\\
\\
\textbf{Solution:} See accompanying Julia notebook. 


\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Problem 2 (5+5 points)}

Suppose that we have a two-argument function $f(x,y)$, where $x,y$
and $f$ may belong to arbitrary vector (Banach) spaces. Let's define
``partial'' derivatives $f_{x}$ and $f_{y}$ (also denoted $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$
and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$) by the linearization: 
\[
df=f(x+dx,y+dy)-f(x,y)=f_{x}(x,y)[dx]+f_{y}(x,y)[dy],
\]
implicitly dropping higher-order terms as usual. Compute the partial
derivatives of the following functions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f(A,x)=A^{-1}x$ for $n\times n$ matrices $A\in\R^{n\times n}$
and vectors $x\in\R^{n}$: give $f_{A}$ as a linear operator,
and $f_{x}$ as a Jacobian matrix.
\\
\\
\textbf{Solution:} By the product rule:
$$
df = \underbrace{-A^{-1}\, dA \, A^{-1} x}_{f_A[dA]} + \underbrace{A^{-1} dx}_{f_x[dx]} \, ,
$$
so $\boxed{f_A[dA] = -A^{-1}\, dA \, A^{-1} x}$ is a linear operator (input $=dA$, output $=$ vector) and $\boxed{f_x = A^{-1}}$ is the Jacobian matrix with respect to $x$.

\item $f(A,B)=\tr(A^{T}BA)$, for matrices $A,B\in\R^{n\times n}$:
give the gradients $\nabla_{A}f$ and $\nabla_{B}f$ such that $f_{A}[dA]=\nabla_{A}f\cdot dA$
and $f_{B}[dB]=\nabla_{B}f\cdot dB$ under the Frobenius inner product
$X\cdot Y=\tr(X^{T}Y)=\tr(Y^{T}X)$.
\\
\\
\textbf{Solution:} By the product rule and the usual trace properties ($\tr XY = \tr YX$, $\tr X = \tr X^T$, $\tr(X+Y)=\tr X + \tr Y$):
\begin{align*}
df &= \tr(dA^T\,BA) + \tr(A^T\,dB\,A) + \tr(A^TB\,dA) \\
&= \tr(A^T B^T\, dA) + \tr(AA^T\,dB) + \tr(A^TB\,dA) \\
&= \tr(A^T (B+B^T)\, dA)+ \tr(AA^T\,dB)
\end{align*}
so we have $\boxed{\nabla_A f = (B+B^T) A}$ and $\boxed{\nabla_B f = AA^T}$.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Problem 3 (5+5 points)}

If $S$ is an $m\times m$ real-symmetric matrix with a ``simple''
(multiplicity $=1$) eigenvalue $\lambda$ and corresponding eigenvector
$q$ ($Sq=\lambda q)$, normalized to $q^{T}q=1$, then the ``Hellman--Feynman
theorem'' states that 
$d\lambda=q^{T}dS\:q$
 for a change $dS$ in the matrix $S$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Derive the Hellman--Feynman theorem by considering the differentials
of both sides of the equations $d(\lambda=q^{T}Sq)$ and $d(q^{T}q=1$).
\\
\\
\textbf{Solution:} By the product rule, and the eigen-equation $Sq=\lambda q$, we get
\begin{align*}
    d\lambda &= dq\,Sq + q^T\,dS\,q + q^TS\,dq \\
    &= \lambda \underbrace{(dq\,q + q^T\,dq)}_{=d(q^T q) =d(1)=0} + q^T\,dS\,q \\
    &= q^T\,dS\,q \, .
\end{align*}
Q.E.D.

\item What is the gradient $\nabla\lambda$ with respect to $S$, for the
usual Frobenius inner product $\nabla\lambda\cdot 
dS=\tr((\nabla\lambda)^{T}dS)$
\\
\\
\textbf{Solution:} We use the fact that $d\lambda = \tr(d\lambda)$ since it is a scalar, combined with the cyclic property of the trace, to obtain:
$$
d\lambda = \tr(d\lambda)=\tr(q^T\,dS\,q)=\tr(qq^T\,dS) \,
$$
and hence $\boxed{\nabla \lambda = (qq^T)^T = qq^T}$.

%\item The \emph{condition number $\kappa$} of \emph{any} full-column-rank
%$m\times n$ matrix $A$ can be defined as $\kappa(A)=\sqrt{\frac{\lambda_{1}}{\lambda_{n}}}$
%where $\lambda_{1}$ and $\lambda_{n}$ are the largest and smallest
%eigenvalues, respectively, of the real-symmetric positive-definite
%matrix $A^{T}A$ (equivalently, these are the squares of the largest and smallest singular values of $A$). Assuming that $\lambda_{1}$ and $\lambda_{n}$
%are simple (multiplicity 1), and corresponding eigenvectors of $A^T A$ ($=$ singular vectors of $A$) are
%$v_{1}$ and $v_{n}$ (normalized to length 1).  Give the matrix $\nabla \kappa$ (with respect to $A$)

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Problem 4 (6+6 points)}
The Jacobian determinant (sometimes called simply ``the Jacobian,'' clashing with the concept of the Jacobian matrix) is
the determinant of the Jacobian matrix.  Specifically if $f(x)$ is a function from $\R^n$ to $\R^n$ and
$(\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j})_{1 \le i,j \le n}$ is the Jacobian matrix $f'(x)$, then its determinant $\det f'(x)$ is the Jacobian determinant.
Sometimes we take the absoute value and not worry too much about the sign.


\begin{enumerate}
\item The Jacobian determinant represents the  local scaling of volume.  Compute the Jacobian determinant of the
hyperbolic rotation defined in Pset 1, problem 1b, in simplest form.  Use this to describe how a little square
around a point generally transforms with a hyperbolic rotation.
\\
\\
\textbf{Solution:} Recall that ``hyperbolic rotation'' from pset~1 was defined by the linear transformation
$$
\underbrace{\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}}_{\vec{x}} \to \underbrace{\begin{pmatrix} \cosh \theta & \sinh \theta \\ \sinh \theta & \cosh\theta \end{pmatrix}}_{H(\theta)} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}
$$
with Jacobian $H(\theta)$, so its Jacobian determinant is simply
$$
\det H(\theta) = \cosh^2(\theta) - \sinh^2(\theta) = \boxed{1} \, .
$$
This means that the transformation \emph{preserves area}, i.e.~an infinitesimal square around a point is transformed to a \emph{rhombus with the same area}.  (Why a rhombus?  Because the columns of $H$, corresponding to the edges of the transformed square, have equal length but are not orthogonal.)


\item   There are many ways to equivalently take a scalar function $f(\alpha)$ and extend it to a matrix function $F(M)$, which takes in a square matrix and returns a square matrix of the same size.

The simplest is to define
$f(M)=X f(\Lambda) X^{-1},$ where $M=X\Lambda X^{-1}$ is an eigen-decomposition of $M$ (and use continuity to include
non-diagonalizable matrices).  Here, $f(\Lambda)$ denotes the application of a scalar function $f(\lambda)$ to the eigenvalues $\lambda$ (on the diagonal of $\Lambda$).  (e.g., you've probably seen $e^M$ defined in terms of $e^\lambda$.)

One could then write $f'(M)$ as an explicit $n^2\times n^2$ Jacobian matrix (e.g. via $\vecm(dM)$ and Kronecker products), and could then  compute its determinant.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Write a computer program (in any language) to find the $9\times 9$ Jacobian matrix of $f(M)$ and then the Jacobian determinant  by either finite differences or by using
automatic differentiation, for $f(\lambda)$ being $e^\lambda$, $\lambda^2$, and $\sin(\lambda)$ on the $3\times 3$ matrix $M = [0\: 1\: 4;1\: 0\: 1;4\: 1\: 0]$ with entries $M_{i,j} = (i-j)^2$.
\\
\\
\textbf{Solution:} The Jacobian determinants should be about $\boxed{939.059, 4096, \text{ and } {-8.41346\times10^{-6}}}$, respectively. See accompanying Julia notebook.


\item Compare with the following known theoretical formula for the 
Jacobian determinant for a scalar function $f(\lambda)$ applied to a diagonalizable matrix $M$,  in terms of $M$'s eigenvalues $\lambda$:
$$
\frac{\prod_{i < j} |f(\lambda_i)-
f(\lambda_j)|^2}{\prod_{i < j} |\lambda_i-\lambda_j|^2}
\prod_i f'(\lambda_i)
$$
\\
\textbf{Solution:} See accompanying Julia notebook.
