<p>{% raw %} # Introduction {#introduction .unnumbered}</p>
<p>These notes are based on the class as it was run for the second time in January 2023, taught by Professors Alan Edelman and Steven&nbsp;G.&nbsp;Johnson at MIT. The previous version of this course, run in January 2022, can be found <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-s096-matrix-calculus-for-machine-learning-and-beyond-january-iap-2022/">on OCW here</a>.</p>
<p>Both Professors Edelman and Johnson use he/him pronouns and are in the Department of Mathematics at MIT; Prof.&nbsp;Edelman is also a Professor in the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) running the Julia lab, while Prof.&nbsp;Johnson is also a Professor in the Department of Physics.</p>
<p>Here is a description of the course.:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>We all know that typical calculus course sequences begin with univariate and vector calculus, respectively. Modern applications such as machine learning and large-scale optimization require the next big step, “matrix calculus” and calculus on arbitrary vector spaces.</p>
<p>This class covers a coherent approach to matrix calculus showing techniques that allow you to think of a matrix holistically (not just as an array of scalars), generalize and compute derivatives of important matrix factorizations and many other complicated-looking operations, and understand how differentiation formulas must be re-imagined in large-scale computing. We will discuss “reverse” (“adjoint”, “backpropagation”) differentiation and how modern automatic differentiation is more computer science than calculus (it is neither symbolic formulas nor finite differences).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The class involved numerous example numerical computations using the Julia language, which you can install on your own computer following <a href="https://github.com/mitmath/julia-mit#installing-julia-and-ijulia-on-your-own-computer">these instructions</a>. The material for this class is also located on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/mitmath/matrixcalc" class="uri">https://github.com/mitmath/matrixcalc</a>.</p>
<section id="overview-and-motivation" class="level1">
<h1>Overview and Motivation</h1>
<p>Firstly, where does matrix calculus fit into the MIT course catalog? Well, there are 18.01 (Single-Variable Calculus) and 18.02 (Vector Calculus) that students are required to take at MIT. But it seems as though this sequence of material is being cut off arbitrarily: <span class="math display">\[\text{Scalar }\to \text{ Vector }\to \text{Matrices}  \to \text{ Higher-Order Arrays?}\]</span> After all, this is how the sequence is portrayed in many computer programming languages, including Julia! Why should calculus stop with vectors?</p>
<p>In the last decade, linear algebra has taken on larger and larger importance in numerous areas, such as machine learning, statistics, engineering, etc. In this sense, linear algebra has gradually taken over a much larger part of today’s tools for lots of areas of study—now everybody needs linear algebra. So it makes sense that we would <em>want</em> to do calculus on these higher-order arrays, and it won’t be a simple/obvious generalization (for instance, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{d}{dA} A^2 \neq 2A\)</span> for non-scalar matrices <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>).</p>
<p>More generally, the subjects of <em>differentiation</em> and <em>sensitivity analysis</em> are much deeper than one might suspect from the simple rules learned in first- or second-semester calculus. Differentiating functions whose inputs and/or outputs are in more complicated vector spaces (e.g.&nbsp;matrices, functions, or more) is one part of this subject. Another topic is the <em>efficient</em> evaluation of derivatives of functions involving very complicated calculations, from neural networks to huge engineering simulations—this leads to the topic of “adjoint” or “reverse-mode” differentiation, also known as “backpropagation.” <em>Automatic differentiation (AD)</em> of computer programs by compilers is another surprising topic, in which the computer does something very different from the typical human process of first writing out an explicit symbolic formula and then passing the chain rule through it. These are only a few examples: the key point is that differentiation is more complicated than you may realize, and that these complexities are increasingly relevant for a wide variety of applications.</p>
<p>Let’s quickly talk about some of these applications.</p>
<section id="applications" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="applications">Applications</h2>
<section id="applications-machine-learning" class="level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="applications-machine-learning">Applications: Machine learning</h3>
<p>Machine learning has numerous buzzwords associated with it, including but not limited to: parameter optimization, stochastic gradient descent, automatic differentiation, and backpropagation. In this whole collage you can see a fraction of how matrix calculus applies to machine learning. It is recommended that you look into some of these topics yourself if you are interested.</p>
</section>
<section id="applications-physical-modeling" class="level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="applications-physical-modeling">Applications: Physical modeling</h3>
<p>Large physical simulations, such as engineering-design problems, are increasingly characterized by <em>huge</em> numbers of parameters, and the <em>derivatives</em> of simulation outputs with respect to these parameters is crucial in order to evaluate sensitivity to uncertainties as well as to apply large-scale optimization.</p>
<p>For example, the shape of an airplane wing might be characterized by thousands of parameters, and if you can compute the derivative of the drag force (from a large fluid-flow simulation) with respect to these parameters then you could optimize the wing shape to minimize the drag for a given lift or other constraints.</p>
<p>An extreme version of such parameterization is known as “topology optimization,” in which the material at “every point” in space is potentially a degree of freedom, and optimizing over these parameters can discover not only a optimal shape but an optimal <em>topology</em> (how materials are connected in space, e.g.&nbsp;how many holes are present). For example, topology optimization has been applied in mechanical engineering to design the cross sections of airplane wings, artificial hips, and more into a complicated lattice of metal struts (e.g.&nbsp;minimizing weight for a given strength).</p>
<p>Besides engineering design, complicated differentiation problems arise in <em>fitting</em> unknown parameters of a model to experimental data, and also in <em>evaluating uncertainties</em> in the outputs of models with imprecise parameters/inputs. This is closely related to regression problems in statistics, as discussed below, except that here the model might be a giant set of differential equations with some unknown parameters.</p>
</section>
<section id="applications-data-science-and-multivariable-statistics" class="level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="applications-data-science-and-multivariable-statistics">Applications: Data science and multivariable statistics</h3>
<p>In multivariate statistics, models are often framed in terms of matrix inputs and outputs (or even more complicated objects such as tensors). For example, a “simple” linear multivariate matrix model might be <span class="math inline">\(Y(X) = XB + U\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is an unknown matrix of coefficients (to be determined by some form of fit/regression) and <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is unknown matrix of random noise (that prevents the model from exactly fitting the data). Regression then involves minimizing some function of the error <span class="math inline">\(U(B) = Y - XB\)</span> between the model <span class="math inline">\(XB\)</span> and data <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>; for example, a matrix norm <span class="math inline">\(\Vert U\Vert_F^2 = \tr U^T U\)</span>, a determinant <span class="math inline">\(\det U^T U\)</span>, or more complicated functions. Estimating the best-fit coefficients <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, analyzing uncertainties, and many other statistical analyses require differentiating such functions with respect to <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> or other parameters. A recent review article on this topic is Liu et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;(2022): “Matrix differential calculus with applications in the multivariate linear model and its diagnostics” (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sctalk.2023.100274" class="uri">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sctalk.2023.100274</a>).</p>
</section>
<section id="applications-automatic-differentiation" class="level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="applications-automatic-differentiation">Applications: Automatic differentiation</h3>
<p>Typical differential calculus classes are based on symbolic calculus, with students essentially learning to do what Mathematica or Wolfram Alpha can do. Even if you are using a computer to take derivatives symbolically, to use this effectively you need to understand what is going on beneath the hood. But while, similarly, some numerics may show up for a small portion of this class (such as to approximate a derivative using the difference quotient), <em>today’s</em> automatic differentiation is neither of those two things. It is more in the field of the computer science topic of compiler technology than mathematics. However, the underlying mathematics of automatic differentiation is interesting, and we will learn about this in this class!</p>
<p>Even <em>approximate</em> computer differentiation is more complicated than you might expect. For single-variable functions <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>, derivatives are defined as the limit of a difference <span class="math inline">\([f(x+\delta x)-f(x)]/\delta x\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\delta x\to 0\)</span>. A crude “finite-difference” approximation is simply to approximate <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)\)</span> by this formula for a small <span class="math inline">\(\delta x\)</span>, but this turns out to raise many interesting issues involving balancing truncation and roundoff errors, higher-order approximations, and numerical extrapolation.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="first-derivatives" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="first-derivatives">First Derivatives</h2>
<p>The derivative of a function of one variable is itself a function of one variable– it simply is (roughly) defined as the linearization of a function. I.e., it is of the form <span class="math inline">\((f(x)-f(x_0)) \approx f'(x_0) (x-x_0)\)</span>. In this sense, “everything is easy” with scalar functions of scalars (by which we mean, functions that take in one number and spit out one number).</p>
<p>There are occasionally other notations used for this linearization:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\delta y \approx f'(x) \delta x\)</span>,</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(dy = f'(x) dx\)</span>,</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\((y-y_0) \approx f'(x_0)(x-x_0)\)</span>,</p></li>
<li><p>and <span class="math inline">\(df = f'(x)  dx\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This last one will be the preferred of the above for this class. One can think of <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(dy\)</span> as “really small numbers.” In mathematics, they are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal">infinitesimals</a>, defined rigorously via taking limits. Note that here we do not want to divide by <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span>. While this is completely fine to do with scalars, once we get to vectors and matrices you can’t always divide!</p>
<p>The numerics of such derivatives are simple enough to play around with. For instance, consider the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = x^2\)</span> and the point <span class="math inline">\((x_0,f(x_0)) = (3,9)\)</span>. Then, we have the following numerical values near <span class="math inline">\((3,9)\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    f(3.\mathbf{0001}) &amp;= 9.\mathbf{0006}0001 \\
    f(3.\mathbf{00001}) &amp;= 9.\mathbf{00006}00001 \\
    f(3.\mathbf{000001}) &amp;= 9.\mathbf{000006}000001 \\
    f(3.\mathbf{0000001}) &amp;= 9.\mathbf{0000006}0000001.
\end{aligned}\]</span> Here, the bolded digits on the left are <span class="math inline">\(\Delta x\)</span> and the bolded digits on the right are <span class="math inline">\(\Delta y\)</span>. Notice that <span class="math inline">\(\Delta y = 6\Delta x\)</span>. Hence, we have that <span class="math display">\[f(3+\Delta x) = 9 + \Delta y = 9+6\Delta x \implies f(3+\Delta x) - f(3) = 6\Delta x \approx f'(3)\Delta x.\]</span> Therefore, we have that the linearization of <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(x=3\)</span> is the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)-f(3) \approx 6(x-3)\)</span>.</p>
<hr>
<p>We now leave the world of scalar calculus and enter the world of vector/matrix calculus! Professor Edelman invites us to think about matrices <em>holistically</em>—not just as a table of numbers.</p>
<p>The notion of linearizing your function will conceptually carry over as we define the derivative of functions which take in/spit out more than one number. Of course, this means that the derivative will have a different “shape” than a single number. Here is a table on the <em>shape</em> of the first derivative. The inputs of the function are given on the left hand side of the table, and the outputs of the function are given across the top.</p>

</table>
<p>You will ultimately learn how to do any of these in great detail eventually in this class! The purpose of this table is to plant the notion of differentials as linearization. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = x^T x\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is a <span class="math inline">\(2\times 1\)</span> matrix and the output is thus a <span class="math inline">\(1\times 1\)</span> matrix. Confirm that <span class="math inline">\(2x_0^T dx\)</span> is indeed the differential of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(x_0 = \begin{pmatrix}  3 &amp; 4\end{pmatrix}^T\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Firstly, let’s compute <span class="math inline">\(f(x_0)\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[f(x_0) = x_0^T x_0 = 3^2 + 4^2 = 25.\]</span> Then, suppose <span class="math inline">\(dx = [.001,.002]\)</span>. Then, we would have that <span class="math display">\[f(x+dx) = (3.001)^2 + (4.002)^2 = 25.\mathbf{022}005.\]</span> Then, notice that <span class="math inline">\(2x_0^T \,dx = 2\begin{pmatrix}
    3  &amp; 4
\end{pmatrix}^T dx = .022\)</span>. Hence, we have that <span class="math display">\[f(x_0 + dx) - f(x_0) \approx 2x_0^{T} dx = .022.\]</span> As we will see right now, the <span class="math inline">\(2x_0^Tdx\)</span> didn’t come from nowhere!</p>
</section>
<section id="intro-matrix-and-vector-product-rule" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="intro-matrix-and-vector-product-rule">Intro: Matrix and Vector Product Rule</h2>
<p>For matrices, we in fact still have a product rule! We will discuss this in much more detail in later chapters, but let’s begin here with a small taste.</p>
<div class="theorem">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(A,B\)</span> be two matrices. Then, we have the differential product rule for <span class="math inline">\(AB\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[d(AB) = (dA)B + A(dB).\]</span> By the differential of the matrix <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, we think of it as a small (unconstrained) change in the matrix <span class="math inline">\(A.\)</span> Later, constraints may be places on the allowed perturbations.</p>
</div>
<p>Notice however, that (by our table) the derivative of a matrix is a matrix! So generally speaking, the products will not commute.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is a vector, then by the differential product rule we have <span class="math display">\[d(x^Tx) = (dx^T)x + x^T (dx).\]</span> However, notice that this is a dot product, and dot products commute (since <span class="math inline">\(\sum a_i \cdot b_i = \sum b_i \cdot a_i\)</span>), we have that <span class="math display">\[d(x^T x) = (2x)^T dx.\]</span></p>
<div class="proof remark">
<p><span class="proof-title"><em>Remark</em>. </span>The way the product rule works for vectors as matrices is that transposes “go for the ride.” See the next example below.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>By the product rule. we have</p>
<ol type="1">

<h1>Derivatives as Linear Operators</h1>
<p>We are now going to revisit the notion of a derivative in a way that we can generalize to higher-order arrays and other vector spaces. We will get into more detail on differentiation as a linear operator, and in particular, will dive deeper into some of the facts we have stated thus far.</p>

<figcaption>The essence of a derivative is <em>linearization</em>: predicting a small change <span class="math inline">\(\delta f\)</span> in the output <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> from a small change <span class="math inline">\(\delta x\)</span> in the input <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, to <em>first order</em> in <span class="math inline">\(\delta x\)</span>.</figcaption>

<p>In a first-semester single-variable calculus course (like 18.01 at MIT), the derivative <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)\)</span> is introduced as the slope of the tangent line at the point <span class="math inline">\((x,f(x))\)</span>, which can also be viewed as a <em>linear approximation</em> of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> near <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. In particular, as depicted in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:derivative-linearization" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:derivative-linearization">1</a>, this is equivalent to a prediction of the <em>change <span class="math inline">\(\delta f\)</span> in the “output”</em> of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> from a small <em>change <span class="math inline">\(\delta x\)</span> in the “input”</em> to first order (<em>linear</em>) in <span class="math inline">\(\delta x\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\delta f = f(x+\delta x) - f(x) =  f'(x) \, \delta x  + \underbrace{(\text{higher-order terms})}_{o(\delta x)}.\]</span> We can more precisely express these higher-order terms using asymptotic “little-o” notation “<span class="math inline">\(o(\delta x)\)</span>”, which denotes any function whose magnitude shrinks much faster than <span class="math inline">\(|\delta x|\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\delta x \to 0\)</span>, so that for sufficiently small <span class="math inline">\(\delta x\)</span> it is negligible compared to the linear <span class="math inline">\(f'(x) \, \delta x\)</span> term. (Variants of this notation are commonly used in computer science, and there is a formal definition that we omit here.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>) Examples of such higher-order terms include <span class="math inline">\((\delta x)^2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((\delta x)^3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((\delta x)^{1.001}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\((\delta x)/\log(\delta x)\)</span>.</p>
<div class="proof remark">
<p><span class="proof-title"><em>Remark</em>. </span>Here, <span class="math inline">\(\delta x\)</span> is <em>not</em> an infinitesimal but rather a small number. Note that our symbol “<span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>” (a Greek lowercase “delta”) is <em>not</em> the same as the symbol “<span class="math inline">\(\partial\)</span>” commonly used to denote partial derivatives.</p>
</div>
<p>This notion of a derivative may remind you of the first two terms in a Taylor series <span class="math inline">\(f(x+\delta x) = f(x) + f'(x) \, \delta x + \cdots\)</span> (though in fact it is much more basic than Taylor series!), and the notation will generalize nicely to higher dimensions and other vector spaces. In differential notation, we can express the same idea as: <span class="math display">\[df = f(x+dx) - f(x) = f'(x) \, dx.\]</span> In this notation we implicitly drop the <span class="math inline">\(o(\delta x)\)</span> term that vanishes in the limit as <span class="math inline">\(\delta x\)</span> becomes infinitesimally small.</p>
<p>We will use this as the more generalized definition of a derivative. In this formulation, we avoid <em>dividing</em> by <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span>, because soon we will allow <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (and hence <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span>) to be something other than a number—if <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> is a vector, we won’t be <em>able</em> to divide by it!</p>

<section id="linear-operators" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="linear-operators">Linear operators</h2>
<p>From the perspective of linear algebra, given a function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, we consider the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, to be the <em>linear operator</em> <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)\)</span> such that <span class="math display">\[df = f(x+ dx) - f(x) = f'(x)[dx].\]</span></p>
<p>As above, you should think of the differential notation <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> as representing an <em>arbitrary small</em> change in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, where we are implicitly dropping any <span class="math inline">\(o(dx)\)</span> terms, i.e.&nbsp;terms that decay faster than linearly as <span class="math inline">\(dx\to 0\)</span>. Often, we will omit the square brackets and write simply <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)dx\)</span> instead of <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)[dx]\)</span>, but this should be understood as the linear operator <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)\)</span> <em>acting on</em> <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span>—don’t write <span class="math inline">\(dx\,f'(x)\)</span>, which will generally be nonsense!</p>
<p>This definition will allow us to extend differentiation to <em>arbitrary vector spaces</em> of inputs <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and outputs <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>. (More technically, we will require vector spaces with a norm <span class="math inline">\(\Vert x \Vert\)</span>, called “Banach spaces,” in order to precisely define the <span class="math inline">\(o(\delta x)\)</span> terms that are dropped. We will come back to the subject of Banach spaces later.)</p>
<div class="recall">
<p>Loosely, a vector space (over <span class="math inline">\(\R\)</span>) is a set of elements in which addition and subtraction between elements is defined, along with multiplication by real scalars. For instance, while it does not make sense to multiply arbitrary vectors in <span class="math inline">\(\R^n\)</span>, we can certainly add them together, and we can certainly scale the vectors by a constant factor.</p>

<p>Some examples of vector spaces include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\R^n\)</span>, as described in the above. More generally, <span class="math inline">\(\R^{n\times m}\)</span>, the space of <span class="math inline">\(n\times m\)</span> matrices with real entries. Notice again that, if <span class="math inline">\(n\neq m\)</span>, then multiplication between elements is not defined.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(C^0(\R^n)\)</span>, the set of continuous functions over <span class="math inline">\(\R^n\)</span>, with addition defined pointwise.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="recall">
<p>Recall that a linear operator is a map <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> from a vector <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> in vector space <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> to a vector <span class="math inline">\(L[v]\)</span> (sometimes denoted simply <span class="math inline">\(Lv\)</span>) in some other vector space. Specifically, <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is linear if <span class="math display">\[L[v_1+v_2] = Lv_1 + Lv_2 \text{~~and~~} L[\alpha v] = \alpha L[v]\]</span> for scalars <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in \mathbb{R}\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Remark</em>: In this course, <span class="math inline">\(f'\)</span> is a map that takes in an <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and spits out a linear operator <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)\)</span> (the <strong>derivative</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>). Furthermore, <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)\)</span> is a linear map that takes in an input direction <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> and gives an output vector <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)[v]\)</span> (which we will later interpret as a directional derivative, see Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:directional" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:directional">2.2.1</a>). When the direction <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is an infinitesimal <span class="math inline">\(d x\)</span>, the output <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)[dx] = df\)</span> is the <strong>differential</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> (the corresponding infinitesimal change in <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>).</p>

<li><p>There are also many other examples of linear operations that are not so convenient or easy to write down as matrix–vector products.

</ul>
<section id="sec:directional" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec:directional">Directional derivatives</h3>
<p>There is an equivalent way to interpret this linear-operator viewpoint of a derivative, which you may have seen before in multivariable calculus: as a <strong>directional derivative</strong>.</p>
<p>If we have a function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> of arbitrary vectors <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, then the directional derivative at <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in a direction (vector) <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is defined as: <span class="math display">\[\left. \frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha} f(x+\alpha v) \right|_{\alpha = 0} = \lim_{\delta\alpha\to 0} \frac{f(x+\delta\alpha \, v) - f(x)}{\delta \alpha}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is a <em>scalar</em>. This transforms derivatives back into <em>single-variable calculus</em> from arbitrary vector spaces. It measures the rate of change of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> in the direction&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> from&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. But it turns out that this has a very simple relationship to our linear operator <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)\)</span> from above, because (dropping higher-order terms due to the limit <span class="math inline">\(\delta\alpha \to 0\)</span>): <span class="math display">\[f(x + \underbrace{d\alpha \, v}_{d x}) - f(x) = f'(x)[dx] = d\alpha \, f'(x)[v] \, ,\]</span> where we have factored out the scalar <span class="math inline">\(d\alpha\)</span> in the last step thanks to <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)\)</span> being a <em>linear</em> operator. Comparing with above, we immediately find that the directional derivative is: <span class="math display">\[\boxed{ \left. \frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha} f(x+\alpha v) \right|_{\alpha = 0} = f'(x)[v]  }\, .\]</span> It is <em>exactly equivalent</em> to our <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)\)</span> from before! (We can also see this as an instance of the chain rule from Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:chainrule" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:chainrule">2.5</a>.) One lesson from this viewpoint is that it is perfectly reasonable to input an arbitrary <em>non-infinitesimal</em> vector <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> into <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)[v]\)</span>: the result is not a <span class="math inline">\(df\)</span>, but is simply a directional derivative.</p>

<figcaption>For a real-valued <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>, the gradient <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span> is defined so that it corresponds to the “uphill” direction at a point <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, which is perpendicular to the contours of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. Although this may not point exactly towards the nearest local maximum of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> (unless the contours are circular), “going uphill” is nevertheless the starting point for many computational-optimization algorithms to search for a maximum.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> be a scalar-valued function, which takes in “column” vectors <span class="math inline">\(x \in \R^n\)</span> and produces a scalar (in <span class="math inline">\(\R\)</span>). Then, <span class="math display">\[df = f(x+ dx) - f(x) = f'(x) [dx] = \text{scalar}.\]</span> Therefore, since <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> is a column vector (in an arbitrary direction, representing an arbitrary small change in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>), the linear operator <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)\)</span> that produces a scalar <span class="math inline">\(df\)</span> must be a <strong>row vector</strong> (a “1-row matrix”, or more formally something called a <em>covector</em> or “dual” vector or “linear form”)! We call this row vector the <em>transpose of the gradient</em> <span class="math inline">\((\nabla f)^T\)</span>, so that <span class="math inline">\(df\)</span> is the <em>dot (“inner”) product of <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> with the gradient</em>. So we have that <span class="math display">\[df = \nabla f \cdot dx = \underbrace{(\nabla f)^T}_{f'(x)} dx \hspace{.25cm} \text{where} \hspace{.25cm} dx = \begin{pmatrix}
dx_1 \\  dx_2 \\ \vdots \\ dx_n.
\end{pmatrix} .\]</span> Some authors view the gradient as a row vector (equating it with <span class="math inline">\(f'\)</span> or the Jacobian), but treating it as a “column vector” (the transpose of <span class="math inline">\(f'\)</span>), as we do in this course, is a common and useful choice. As a column vector, the gradient can be viewed as the “uphill” (<em>steepest-ascent</em>) direction in the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> space, as depicted in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:gradient-uphill" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:gradient-uphill">2</a>. Furthermore, it is also easier to generalize to scalar functions of other vector spaces. In any case, for this class, we will <em>always</em> define <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span> to <em>have the same “shape” as <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span></em>, so that <span class="math inline">\(df\)</span> is a dot product (“inner product”) of <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> with the gradient.</p>
<p>This is perfectly consistent with the viewpoint of the gradient that you may remember from multivariable calculus, in which the gradient was a vector of components <span class="math display">\[\nabla f = \begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} \\  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2} \\ \vdots \\ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n}
\end{pmatrix} \, ;\]</span> or, equivalently, <span class="math display">\[df = f(x+dx)-f(x) = \nabla f \cdot dx = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} dx_1 + \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2} dx_2 + \cdots + \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n} dx_n \, .\]</span> While a component-wise viewpoint may sometimes be convenient, we want to encourage you to view the vector <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> as a <em>whole</em>, not simply a collection of components, and to learn that it is often more convenient and elegant to differentiate expressions <em>without</em> taking the derivative component-by-component, a new approach that will generalize better to more complicated inputs/output vector spaces.</p>
<p>Let’s look at an example to see how we compute this differential.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = x^T Ax\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(x\in \R^n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is a square <span class="math inline">\(n\times n\)</span> matrix, and thus <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \in \R\)</span>. Compute <span class="math inline">\(df\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>We can do this directly from the definition. <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    df &amp;= f(x+ dx) - f(x) \\
    &amp;=  (x+ dx)^T A (x+dx) - x^T A x \\
    &amp;= \cancel{x^T A x} + dx^T\, Ax + x^T A dx + \cancelto{\text{higher order}}{dx^T \,A dx} - \cancel{x^T A x} \\
    &amp;= \underbrace{x^T(A+A^T)}_{f'(x)=(\nabla f)^T }dx \implies \nabla f = (A+A^T)x \, .
\end{aligned}\]</span> Here, we dropped terms with more than one <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> factor as these are asymptotically negligible. Another trick was to combine <span class="math inline">\(dx^T A x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x^T A dx\)</span> by realizing that these are <em>scalars</em> and hence equal to their own transpose: <span class="math inline">\(dx^T A x = (dx^T A x)^T = x^T A^T dx\)</span>. Hence, we have found that <span class="math inline">\(f'(x) = x^T(A+A^T) = (\nabla f)^T\)</span>, or equivalently <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f = [x^T(A+A^T)]^T = (A+A^T)x\)</span>.</p>
<p>It is, of course, also possible to compute the same gradient component-by-component, the way you probably learned to do in multivariable calculus. First, you would need to write <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> explicitly in terms of the components of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, as <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = x^T A x = \sum_{i,j} x_i A_{i,j} x_j\)</span>. Then, you would compute <span class="math inline">\(\partial f/\partial x_k\)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, taking care that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> appears twice in the <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> summation. However, this approach is awkward, error-prone, labor-intensive, and quickly becomes worse as we move on to more complicated functions. It is much better, we feel, to get used to treating vectors and matrices <em>as a whole</em>, not as mere collections of numbers.</p>

<p>Next time, we will revisit multi-variable calculus (18.02 at MIT) again in a Part 2, where now <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> will be a vector-valued function, taking in vectors <span class="math inline">\(x\in \R^n\)</span> and giving vector outputs <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \in \R^m\)</span>. Then, <span class="math inline">\(df\)</span> will be a <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>-component column vector, <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> will be an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-component column vector, and we must get a linear operator <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)\)</span> satisfying <span class="math display">\[\underbrace{df}_{m\text{ components}} = \underbrace{f'(x)}_{m \times n} \underbrace{dx}_{n\text{ components}} \, ,\]</span> so <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)\)</span> must be an <span class="math inline">\(m \times n\)</span> <em>matrix</em> called the <em>Jacobian</em> of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>!</p>
<p>The Jacobian matrix <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> represents the linear operator that takes <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(df\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[df = J dx \, .\]</span> The matrix <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> has entries <span class="math inline">\(J_{ij}=\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}\)</span> (corresponding to the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th row and the <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>-th column of <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span>).</p>
<p>So now, suppose that <span class="math inline">\(f: \R^2 \to \R^2\)</span>. Let’s understand how we would compute the differential of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[df = \begin{pmatrix}

\end{pmatrix}.\]</span></p>
<p>Let’s compute an example.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="ex1" data-label="ex1"></span> Consider the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = Ax\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is a constant <span class="math inline">\(m\times n\)</span> matrix.

<li><p><strong>Sum Rule</strong>: Given <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = g(x) + h(x)\)</span>, we get that <span class="math display">\[df = dg + dh \implies f'(x) dx = g'(x) dx + h'(x)dx.\]</span> Hence, <span class="math inline">\(f' = g'+h'\)</span> as we should expect. This is the linear operator <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)[v] = g'(x)[v] + h'(x)[v]\)</span>, and note that we can sum linear operators (like <span class="math inline">\(g'\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h'\)</span>) just like we can sum matrices! In this way, linear operators form a vector space.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product Rule</strong>: Suppose <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = g(x) h(x)\)</span>. Then, $$</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        df &amp;= f(x+ dx) - f(x) \\
        &amp;= g(x+dx) h(x+dx) - g(x) h(x) \\
        &amp;= (g(x) + \underbrace{g'(x) dx}_{dg}) (h(x) + \underbrace{h'(x)dx}_{dh}) - g(x)h(x) \\
        &amp;= g h + dg\, h + g\,dh + \cancelto{0}{dg \,dh} - gh \\
        &amp;= dg \, h + g \,dh \, ,

\end{aligned}\]</span>
<p>$$ where the <span class="math inline">\(dg \, dh\)</span> term is higher-order and hence dropped in infinitesimal notation. Note, as usual, that <span class="math inline">\(dg\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> may not commute now as they may no longer be scalars!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s look at some short examples of how we can apply the product rule nicely.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="ex:Ax" data-label="ex:Ax"></span> Let <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = Ax\)</span> (mapping <span class="math inline">\(\R^n \to \R^m\)</span>) where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is a constant <span class="math inline">\(m\times n\)</span> matrix. Then, <span class="math display">\[df = d(Ax) =  \cancelto{0}{dA} \, x + Adx = Adx \implies f'(x) = A.\]</span> We have <span class="math inline">\({dA} = 0\)</span> here because <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> does not change when we change <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = x^T A x\)</span> (mapping <span class="math inline">\(\R^n \to \R\)</span>). Then, <span class="math display">\[df = dx^T(Ax) + x^T d(Ax) = \underbrace{dx^T \, Ax}_{=\, x^T A^Tdx} + x^T Adx = x^T(A+A^T)dx  = (\nabla f)^T dx\, ,\]</span> and hence <span class="math inline">\(f'(x) = x^T(A + A^T)\)</span>. (In the common case where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is symmetric, this simplifies to <span class="math inline">\(f'(x) = 2x^T A\)</span>.) Note that here we have applied Example&nbsp;<a href="#ex:Ax" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ex:Ax">[ex:Ax]</a> in computing <span class="math inline">\(d(Ax) = A dx\)</span>. Furthermore, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a scalar valued function, so we may also obtain the gradient <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f = (A+A^T) x\)</span> as before (which simplifies to <span class="math inline">\(2Ax\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is symmetric).</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>Given <span class="math inline">\(x,y\in \R^m\)</span>, define <span class="math display">\[x\mathbin{.*}y = \begin{pmatrix}
        x_1y_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_my_m
    \end{pmatrix} = \underbrace{\begin{pmatrix} x_1 &amp; &amp; &amp; \\ &amp; x_2 &amp; &amp; \\ &amp; &amp; \ddots &amp; \\ &amp; &amp; &amp; x_m \end{pmatrix}}_{\mathrm{diag}(x)} \begin{pmatrix}

Then, given <span class="math inline">\(A \in \R^{m,n}\)</span>, define <span class="math inline">\(f:\R^n \to \R^m\)</span> via <span class="math display">\[f(x) = A(x\mathbin{.*}x).\]</span></p>
<p>As an exercise, one can verify the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(x\mathbin{.*}y = y\mathbin{.*}x\)</span>,</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(A(x\mathbin{.*}y) = A \, \mathrm{diag}(x)\, y\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(d(x\mathbin{.*}y) = (dx)\mathbin{.*}y + x\mathbin{.*}(dy)\)</span>. So if we take <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> to be a constant and define <span class="math inline">\(g(x) = y \mathbin{.*}x\)</span>, its Jacobian matrix is <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{diag}(y)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(df = A(2x\mathbin{.*}dx) = 2A \, \mathrm{diag}(x) \, dx = f'(x)[dx]\)</span>, so the Jacobian matrix is <span class="math inline">\(J = 2A \, \mathrm{diag}(x)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Notice that the directional derivative (Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:directional" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:directional">2.2.1</a>) of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in the direction <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is simply given by <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)[v] = 2A (x \mathbin{.*}v)\)</span>. One could also check numerically for some arbitrary <span class="math inline">\(A,x,v\)</span> that <span class="math inline">\(f(x + 10^{-8} v) - f(x) \approx 10^{-8} ( 2A (x \mathbin{.*}v))\)</span>.</p></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec:chainrule">The Chain Rule</h2>
<p>One of the most important rules from differential calculus is the chain rule, because it allows us to differentiate complicated functions built out of compositions of simpler functions. This chain rule can also be generalized to our differential notation in order to work for functions on arbitrary vector spaces:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Chain Rule</strong>: Let <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = g(h(x))\)</span>. Then, $$</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    df = f(x + dx) - f(x) &amp;= g(h( x + dx)) - g(h(x)) \\
    &amp;= g'(h(x))[h(x + dx) - h(x)] \\
    &amp;= g'(h(x))[h'(x)[dx]] \\
    &amp;= g'(h(x)) h'(x) [dx]

\end{aligned}\]</span>
<p>$$ where <span class="math inline">\(g'(h(x))h'(x)\)</span> is a composition of <span class="math inline">\(g'\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h'\)</span> as matrices.</p>
<p>In other words, <span class="math inline">\(f'(x) = g'(h(x)) h'(x)\)</span>: the Jacobian (linear operator) <span class="math inline">\(f'\)</span> is simply the <em>product (composition) of the Jacobians</em>, <span class="math inline">\(g' h'\)</span>. Ordering matters because linear operators do not generally commute: left-to-right = outputs-to-inputs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s look more carefully at the <em>shapes</em> of these Jacobian matrices in an example where each function maps a column vector to a column vector:</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(x\in \R^n\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(h(x) \in \R^p\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(g(h(x)) \in \R^m\)</span>. Then, let <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = g(h(x))\)</span> mapping from <span class="math inline">\(\R^n\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\R^m\)</span>. The chain rule then states that <span class="math display">\[f'(x) = g'(h(x)) h'(x),\]</span> which makes sense as <span class="math inline">\(g'\)</span> is an <span class="math inline">\(m\times p\)</span> matrix and <span class="math inline">\(h'\)</span> is a <span class="math inline">\(p\times n\)</span> matrix, so that the product gives an <span class="math inline">\(m \times n\)</span> matrix <span class="math inline">\(f'\)</span>! However, notice that this is <em>not</em> the same as <span class="math inline">\(h'(x) g'(h(x))\)</span> as you cannot (if <span class="math inline">\(n\neq m\)</span>) multiply a <span class="math inline">\(p\times n\)</span> and an <span class="math inline">\(m\times p\)</span> matrix together, and even if <span class="math inline">\(n = m\)</span> you will get the wrong answer since they probably won’t commute.</p>
</div>
<p>Not only does the order of the multiplication matter, but the associativity of matrix multiplication matters <em>practically</em>. Let’s consider a function <span class="math display">\[f(x)= a(b(c(x)))\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(c: \R^n \to \R^p\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b:\R^p \to \R^q\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(a: \R^q\to \R^m\)</span>. Then, we have that, by the chain rule, <span class="math display">\[f'(x) = a'(b(c(x))) b'(c(x))c'(x).\]</span> Notice that this is the same as <span class="math display">\[f'  = (a' b')c' = a'(b'c')\]</span> by associativity (omitting the function arguments for brevity). The left-hand side is multiplication from left to right, and the right-hand side is multiplication from right to left.</p>
<p>But who cares? Well it turns out that associativity is deeply important. So important that the two orderings have names: multiplying left-to-right is called “reverse mode” and multiplying right-to-left is called “forward mode” in the field of <em>automatic differentiation</em> (AD). Reverse-mode differentation is also known as an “adjoint method” or “backpropagation” in some contexts, which we will explore in more detail later. Why does this matter? Let’s think about the computational cost of matrix multiplication.</p>
<section id="sec:cost-matrix-mult" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec:cost-matrix-mult">Cost of Matrix Multiplication</h3>
<div id="fig:matrix-mult-assoc" class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center anchored">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="figures/matrix-mult-assoc.pdf.svg" class="img-fluid figure-img" style="width:80.0%"></p>
<figcaption>Matrix multiplication is <em>associative</em>—that is, <span class="math inline">\((AB)C = A(BC)\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(A,B,C\)</span>—but multiplying left-to-right can be much more efficient than right-to-left if the leftmost matrix has only one (or few) rows, as shown here. Correspondingly, the order in which you carry out the chain rule has dramatic consequences for the computational effort required. Left-to-right is known as “reverse mode” or “backpropagation”, and is best suited to situations where there are many fewer outputs than inputs.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>If you multiply a <span class="math inline">\(m\times q\)</span> matrix by a <span class="math inline">\(q\times p\)</span> matrix, you normally do it by computing <span class="math inline">\(mp\)</span> dot products of length <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> (or some equivalent re-ordering of these operations). To do a dot product of length <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> requires <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> multiplications and <span class="math inline">\(q-1\)</span> additions of scalars. Overall, this is approximately <span class="math inline">\(2mpq\)</span> scalar operations in total. In computer science, you would write that this is “<span class="math inline">\(\Theta(mpq)\)</span>”: the computational effort is <em>asymptotically proportional</em> to <span class="math inline">\(mpq\)</span> for large <span class="math inline">\(m,p,q\)</span>.</p>
<p>So why does the order of the chain rule matter? Consider the following two examples.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Suppose you have a lot of inputs <span class="math inline">\(n \gg 1\)</span>, and only one output <span class="math inline">\(m=1\)</span>, with lots of intermediate values, i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(q=p=n\)</span>. Then reverse mode (left-to-right) will cost <span class="math inline">\(\Theta(n^2)\)</span> scalar operations while forward mode (right-to-left) would cost <span class="math inline">\(\Theta(n^3)\)</span>! This is a huge cost difference, depicted schematically in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:matrix-mult-assoc" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:matrix-mult-assoc">3</a>.</p>
<p>Conversely, suppose you have a lot of outputs <span class="math inline">\(m \gg 1\)</span> and only one input <span class="math inline">\(n=1\)</span>, with lots of intermediate values <span class="math inline">\(q=p=m\)</span>. Then reverse mode would cost <span class="math inline">\(\Theta(m^3)\)</span> operations but forward mode would be only <span class="math inline">\(\Theta(m^2)\)</span>!</p>
<p>Moral: If you have a lot of inputs and few outputs (the usual case in machine learning and optimization), compute the chain rule left-to-right (reverse mode). If you have a lot of outputs and few inputs, compute the chain rule right-to-left (forward mode). We return to this in Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:forward-vs-reverse" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:forward-vs-reverse">8.4</a>.</p>

<section id="beyond-multi-variable-derivatives" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="beyond-multi-variable-derivatives">Beyond Multi-Variable Derivatives</h2>
<p>Now let’s compute some derivatives that go beyond first-year calculus, where the inputs and outputs are in more general vector spaces. For instance, consider the following examples:</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> be an <span class="math inline">\(n\times n\)</span> matrix. You could have the following matrix-valued functions. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(f(A) = A^3\)</span>,</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(f(A) = A^{-1}\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is invertible,</p></li>
<li><p>or <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is the resulting matrix after applying Gaussian elimination to <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You could also have scalar outputs. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(f(A) = \det A\)</span>,</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(f(A) =\)</span> trace <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>,</p></li>
<li><p>or <span class="math inline">\(f(A) = \sigma_1(A)\)</span>, the largest singular value of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Let’s focus on two simpler examples for this lecture.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(f(A) = A^3\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is a square matrix. Compute <span class="math inline">\(df\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Here, we apply the chain rule one step at a time: <span class="math display">\[df = dA\, A^2 + A \,dA \, A + A^2 \,dA = f'(A) [dA].\]</span> Notice that this is not equal to <span class="math inline">\(3A^2\)</span> (unless <span class="math inline">\(dA\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> commute, which won’t generally be true since <span class="math inline">\(dA\)</span> represents an <em>arbitrary</em> small change in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>). The right-hand side is a linear operator <span class="math inline">\(f'(A)\)</span> acting on <span class="math inline">\(dA\)</span>, but it is not so easy to interpret it as simply a single “Jacobian” matrix multiplying <span class="math inline">\(dA\)</span>!</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(f(A) = A^{-1}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is a square invertible matrix. Compute <span class="math inline">\(df = d(A^{-1})\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Here, we use a slight trick. Notice that <span class="math inline">\(AA^{-1} = \Id\)</span>, the identity matrix. Thus, we can compute the differential using the product rule (noting that <span class="math inline">\(d\Id = 0\)</span>, since changing <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> does not change <span class="math inline">\(\Id\)</span>) so <span class="math display">\[d(AA^{-1}) = dA\, A^{-1} + A\,d(A^{-1}) = d(\Id) = 0\implies d(A^{-1}) = -A^{-1} \,dA \,A^{-1}.\]</span></p>

<h1>Jacobians of Matrix Functions</h1>
<p>When we have a function that has <em>matrices</em> as inputs and/or outputs, we have already seen in the previous lectures that we can still define the derivative as a linear operator by a <em>formula</em> for <span class="math inline">\(f'\)</span> mapping a small change in input to the corresponding small change in output. However, when you first learned linear algebra, probably most linear operations were represented by matrices multiplying vectors, and it may take a while to get used to thinking of linear operations more generally. In this chapter, we discuss how it is still <em>possible</em> to represent <span class="math inline">\(f'\)</span> by a <strong>Jacobian matrix</strong> even for matrix inputs/outputs, and how the most common technique to do this involves <strong>matrix “vectorization”</strong> and a new type of matrix operation, a <strong>Kronecker product</strong>. This gives us another way to think about our <span class="math inline">\(f'\)</span> linear operators that is occasionally convenient, but at the same time it is important to become comfortable with other ways of writing down linear operators too—sometimes, the explicit Jacobian-matrix approach can obscure key structure, and it is often computationally inefficient as well.</p>
<p>For this section of the notes, we refer to the linked <a href="https://rawcdn.githack.com/mitmath/matrixcalc/3f6758996e40c5c1070279f89f7f65e76e08003d/notes/2x2Jacobians.jl.html">Pluto Notebook</a> for computational demonstrations of this material in Julia, illustrating multiple views of the derivative of the square <span class="math inline">\(A^{2}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(2\times2\)</span> matrices <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<section id="derivatives-of-matrix-functions-linear-operators" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="derivatives-of-matrix-functions-linear-operators">Derivatives of matrix functions: Linear operators</h2>
<p>As we have already emphasized, the derivative <span class="math inline">\(f'\)</span> is the linear operator that maps a small change in the input to a small change in the output. This idea can take an unfamiliar form, however, when applied to functions <span class="math inline">\(f(A)\)</span> that map matrix inputs <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to matrix outputs. For example, we’ve already considered the following functions on square <span class="math inline">\(m\times m\)</span> matrices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(f(A)=A^{3}\)</span>, which gives <span class="math inline">\(df=f'(A)[dA]=dA\,A^{2}+A\,dA\,A+A^{2}\,dA\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(f(A)=A^{-1}\)</span>, which gives <span class="math inline">\(df=f'(A)[dA]=-A^{-1}\,dA\,A^{-1}\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<div class="example">
<p>An even simpler example is the <em>matrix-square</em> function:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(A)=A^{2}\,,\]</span> which by the product rule gives <span class="math display">\[df=f'(A)[dA]=dA\,A+A\,dA\,.\]</span> You can also work this out explicitly from <span class="math inline">\(df=f(A+dA)-f(A)=(A+dA)^{2}-A^{2}\)</span>, dropping the <span class="math inline">\((dA)^{2}\)</span> term.</p>
</div>
<p>In all of these examples, <span class="math inline">\(f'(A)\)</span> is described by a simple formula for <span class="math inline">\(f'(A)[dA]\)</span> that relates an arbitrary change <span class="math inline">\(dA\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to the change <span class="math inline">\(df=f(A+dA)-f(A)\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, to first order. If the differential is distracting you, realize that we can plug any matrix <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> we want into this formula, not just an “infinitesimal” change <span class="math inline">\(dA\)</span>, e.g.&nbsp;in our matrix-square example we have <span class="math display">\[f'(A)[X]=XA+AX\]</span> for an arbitrary <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> (a directional derivative, from Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:directional" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:directional">2.2.1</a>). This is <em>linear</em> in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>: if we scale or add inputs, it scales or adds outputs, respectively: <span class="math display">\[f'(A)[2X]=2XA+A\,2X=2(XA+AX)=2f'(A)[X]\,,\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
f'(A)[X+Y] &amp; =(X+Y)A+A(X+Y)=XA+YA+AX+AY=XA+AX+YA+AY\\
&amp; =f'(A)[X]+f'(A)[Y]\,.
\end{aligned}\]</span> This is a perfectly good way to define a linear operation! We are <em>not</em> expressing it here in the familiar form <span class="math inline">\(f'(A)[X]=(\text{some matrix?})\times(X\text{ vector?})\)</span>, and that’s okay! A formula like <span class="math inline">\(XA+AX\)</span> is easy to write down, easy to understand, and easy to compute with.</p>
<p>But sometimes you still may want to think of <span class="math inline">\(f'\)</span> as a single “Jacobian” matrix, using the most familiar language of linear algebra, and it is possible to do that! If you took a sufficiently abstract linear-algebra course, you may have learned that <em>any</em> linear operator can be represented by a matrix once you choose a basis for the input and output vector spaces. Here, however, we will be much more concrete, because there is a conventional “Cartesian” basis for matrices <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> called “vectorization”, and in this basis linear operators like <span class="math inline">\(AX+XA\)</span> are particularly easy to represent in matrix form once we introduce a new type of matrix product that has widespread applications in “multidimensional” linear algebra.</p>

<section id="a-simple-example-the-two-by-two-matrix-square-function" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-simple-example-the-two-by-two-matrix-square-function">A simple example: The two-by-two matrix-square function</h2>
<p>To begin with, let’s look in more detail at our matrix-square function <span class="math display">\[f(A)=A^{2}\]</span> for the simple case of <span class="math inline">\(2\times2\)</span> matrices, which are described by only four scalars, so that we can look at every term in the derivative explicitly. In particular,</p>
<div class="example">
<p>For a <span class="math inline">\(2\times2\)</span> matrix <span class="math display">\[A=\begin{pmatrix}p &amp; r\\
q &amp; s

q &amp; s
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}p^{2}+qr &amp; pr+rs\\

\end{pmatrix}.\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Written out explicitly in terms of the matrix entries <span class="math inline">\((p,q,r,s)\)</span> in this way, it is natural to think of our function as mapping 4 scalar inputs to 4 scalar outputs. That is, we can think of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> as equivalent to a “vectorized” function <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{f}:\R^{4}\to\R^{4}\)</span> given by <span class="math display">\[\tilde{f}(\left(\begin{array}{c}

<p>Vectorization turns unfamilar things (like matrix functions and derivatives thereof) into familiar things (like vector functions and Jacobians or gradients thereof). In that way, it can be a very attractive tool, almost <em>too</em> attractive—why do “matrix calculus” if you can turn everything back into ordinary multivariable calculus? Vectorization has its drawbacks, however: conceptually, it can obscure the underlying mathematical structure (e.g.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(\tilde{f}\)</span> above doesn’t look much like a matrix square <span class="math inline">\(A^{2}\)</span>), and computationally this loss of structure can sometimes lead to severe inefficiencies (e.g.&nbsp;forming huge <span class="math inline">\(m^2\times m^2\)</span> Jacobian matrices as discussed below). Overall, we believe that the <em>primary</em> way to study matrix functions like this should be to view them as having matrix inputs (<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>) and matrix outputs (<span class="math inline">\(A^{2}\)</span>), and that one should likewise generally view the derivatives as linear operators on matrices, not vectorized versions thereof. However, it is still useful to be familiar with the vectorization viewpoint in order to have the benefit of an alternative perspective.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-matrix-squaring-four-by-four-jacobian-matrix">The matrix-squaring four-by-four Jacobian matrix</h3>
<p>To understand Jacobians of functions (from matrices to matrices), let’s begin by considering a basic question:</p>
<div class="question">
<p>What is the <em>size</em> of the Jacobian of the matrix-square function?</p>
</div>
<p>Well, if we view the matrix squaring function via its vectorized equivalent <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{f}\)</span>, mapping <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^{4}\mapsto\mathbb{R}^{4}\)</span> (4-component column vectors to 4-component column vectors), the Jacobian would be a <span class="math inline">\(4\times4\)</span> matrix (formed from the derivatives of each output component with respect to each input component). Now let’s think about a more general square matrix <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>: an <span class="math inline">\(m\times m\)</span> matrix. If we wanted to find the Jacobian of <span class="math inline">\(f(A)=A^{2}\)</span>, we could do so by the same process and (symbolically) obtain an <span class="math inline">\(m^{2}\times m^{2}\)</span> matrix (since there are <span class="math inline">\(m^{2}\)</span> inputs, the entries of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(m^{2}\)</span> outputs, the entries of <span class="math inline">\(A^{2}\)</span>). Explicit computation of these <span class="math inline">\(m^{4}\)</span> partial derivatives is rather tedious even for small <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, but is a task that symbolic computational tools in e.g.&nbsp;Julia or Mathematica can handle. In fact, as seen in the <a href="https://rawcdn.githack.com/mitmath/matrixcalc/3f6758996e40c5c1070279f89f7f65e76e08003d/notes/2x2Jacobians.jl.html">Notebook</a>, Julia spits out the Jacobian quite easily. For the <span class="math inline">\(m=2\)</span> case that we wrote out explicitly above, you can either take the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{f}\)</span> by hand or use Julia’s symbolic tools to obtain the Jacobian: <span class="math display">\[\tilde{f}'=%

\,.\]</span> For example, the first row of <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{f}'\)</span> consists of the partial derivatives of <span class="math inline">\(p^{2}+qr\)</span> (the first output) with respect to the 4 inputs <span class="math inline">\(p,q,r,\mbox{and }s\)</span>. Here, we have labeled the rows by the (row,column) indices <span class="math inline">\((j_\mathrm{out}, k_\mathrm{out})\)</span> of the entries in the “output” matrix <span class="math inline">\(d(A^2)\)</span>, and have labeled the columns by the indices <span class="math inline">\((j_\mathrm{in}, k_\mathrm{in})\)</span> of the entries in the “input” matrix <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Although we have written the Jacobian <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{f}'\)</span> as a “2d” matrix, you can therefore also imagine it to be a “4d” matrix indexed by <span class="math inline">\(j_\mathrm{out}, k_\mathrm{out}, j_\mathrm{in}, k_\mathrm{in}\)</span>.</p>
<p>However, the matrix-calculus approach of viewing the derivative <span class="math inline">\(f'(A)\)</span> as a <em>linear transformation on matrices</em> (as we derived above), <span class="math display">\[f'(A)[X]=XA+AX\,,\]</span> seems to be much more revealing than writing out an explicit component-by-component “vectorized” Jacobian <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{f}'\)</span>, and gives a formula for any <span class="math inline">\(m\times m\)</span> matrix without laboriously requiring us to take <span class="math inline">\(m^{4}\)</span> partial derivatives one-by-one. If we really want to pursue the vectorization perspective, we need a way to recapture some of the structure that is obscured by tedious componentwise differentiation. A key tool to bridge the gap between the two perspectives is a type of matrix operation that you may not be familiar with: <strong>Kronecker products</strong> (denoted <span class="math inline">\(\otimes\)</span>).</p>

<p>A linear operation like <span class="math inline">\(f'(A)[X]=XA+AX\)</span> can be thought of as a “higher-dimensional matrix:” ordinary “2d” matrices map “1d” column vectors to 1d column vectors, whereas to map 2d matrices to 2d matrices you might imagine a “4d” matrix (sometimes called a <em>tensor</em>). To transform 2d matrices back into 1d vectors, we already saw the concept of vectorization (<span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{vec}A\)</span>). A closely related tool, which transforms “higher dimensional” linear operations on matrices back into “2d” matrices for the vectorized inputs/outputs, is the Kronecker product <span class="math inline">\(A\otimes B\)</span>. Although they don’t often appear in introductory linear-algebra courses, Kronecker products show up in a wide variety of mathematical applications where multidimensional data arises, such as multivariate statistics and data science or multidimensional scientific/engineering problems.</p>

<p><span id="prop5000" data-label="prop5000"></span> Given (compatibly sized) matrices <span class="math inline">\(A,B,C\)</span>, we have <span class="math display">\[(A\otimes B)\operatorname{vec}(C)=\operatorname{vec}(BCA^{T}).\]</span> We can thus view <span class="math inline">\(A\otimes B\)</span> as a vectorized equivalent of the linear operation <span class="math inline">\(C\mapsto BCA^{T}\)</span>. We are tempted to introduce a parallel notation <span class="math inline">\((A\otimes B)[C]=BCA^{T}\)</span> for the “non-vectorized” version of this operation, although this notation is not standard.</p>
<p>One possible mnemonic for this identity is that the <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is just to the left of the <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> while the <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> “circles around” to the right and gets transposed.</p>
</div>
<p>Where does this identity come from? We can break it into simpler pieces by first considering the cases where either <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is an identity matrix <span class="math inline">\(\Id\)</span> (of the appropriate size). To start with, suppose that <span class="math inline">\(A=\Id\)</span>, so that <span class="math inline">\(BCA^{T}=BC\)</span>. What is <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{vec}(BC)\)</span>? If we let <span class="math inline">\(\vec{c}_{1},\vec{c}_{2},\ldots\)</span> denote the columns of <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, then recall that <span class="math inline">\(BC\)</span> simply multiples <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> on the left with each of the columns of <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[BC=B\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
\vec{c}_{1} &amp; \vec{c}_{2} &amp; \cdots\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
B\vec{c}_{1} &amp; B\vec{c}_{2} &amp; \cdots\end{array}\right)\Longrightarrow\operatorname{vec}(BC)=\left(\begin{array}{c}
B\vec{c}_{1}\\
B\vec{c}_{2}\\
\vdots
\end{array}\right).\]</span> Now, how can we get this <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{vec}(BC)\)</span> vector as something multiplying <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{vec}C\)</span>? It should be immediately apparent that <span class="math display">\[\operatorname{vec}(BC)=\left(\begin{array}{c}
B\vec{c}_{1}\\
B\vec{c}_{2}\\
\vdots
\end{array}\right)=\underbrace{\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
B\\
&amp; B\\
&amp;  &amp; \ddots
\end{array}\right)}_{\Id\otimes B}\underbrace{\left(\begin{array}{c}
\vec{c}_{1}\\
\vec{c}_{2}\\
\vdots
\end{array}\right)}_{\operatorname{vec}C},\]</span> but this matrix is exactly the Kronecker product <span class="math inline">\(I\otimes B\)</span>! Hence, we have derived that <span class="math display">\[(\Id\otimes B)\operatorname{vec}C=\operatorname{vec}(BC).\]</span> What about the <span class="math inline">\(A^{T}\)</span> term? This is a little trickier, but again let’s simplify to the case where <span class="math inline">\(B=\Id\)</span>, in which case <span class="math inline">\(BCA^{T}=CA^{T}\)</span>. To vectorize this, we need to look at the columns of <span class="math inline">\(CA^{T}\)</span>. What is the first column of <span class="math inline">\(CA^{T}\)</span>? It is a linear combination of the columns of <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> whose coefficients are given by the first column of <span class="math inline">\(A^{T}\)</span> (=&nbsp;first row of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>): <span class="math display">\[\text{column 1 of }CA^{T}=\sum_{j}a_{1j}\vec{c}_{j}\:.\]</span> Similarly for column&nbsp;2, etc, and we then “stack” these columns to get <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{vec}(CA^{T})\)</span>. But this is exactly the formula for multipling a matrix <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> by a vector, if the “elements” of the vector were the columns <span class="math inline">\(\vec{c}_{j}\)</span>. Written out explicitly, this becomes: <span class="math display">\[\operatorname{vec}(CA^{T})=\left(\begin{array}{c}
\sum_{j}a_{1j}\vec{c}_{j}\\
\sum_{j}a_{2j}\vec{c}_{j}\\
\vdots
\end{array}\right)=\underbrace{\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
a_{11}\Id &amp; a_{12}\Id &amp; \cdots\\
a_{21}\Id &amp; a_{22}\Id &amp; \cdots\\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots
\end{array}\right)}_{A\otimes\Id}\underbrace{\left(\begin{array}{c}
\vec{c}_{1}\\
\vec{c}_{2}\\
\vdots
\end{array}\right)}_{\operatorname{vec}C},\]</span> and hence we have derived <span class="math display">\[(A\otimes\Id)\operatorname{vec}C=\operatorname{vec}(CA^{T}).\]</span> The full identity <span class="math inline">\((A\otimes B)\operatorname{vec}(C)=\operatorname{vec}(BCA^{T})\)</span> can then be obtained by straightforwardly combining these two derivations: replace <span class="math inline">\(CA^T\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(BCA^T\)</span> in the second derivation, which replaces <span class="math inline">\(\vec{c}_j\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(B\vec{c}_j\)</span> and hence <span class="math inline">\(\Id\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>.</p>

<p>Let’s use the same trick for the matrix-cube function. Sure, we could laboriously compute the Jacobian via element-by-element partial derivatives (which is done nicely by symbolic computing in the notebook), but it’s much easier and more elegant to use Kronecker products. Recall that our “non-vectorized” matrix-calculus derivative is the linear operator: <span class="math display">\[(A^{3})'[dA]=dA\,A^{2}+A\,dA\,A+A^{2}\,dA,\]</span> which now vectorizes by three applications of the Kronecker identity: <span class="math display">\[\operatorname{vec}(dA\,A^{2}+A\,dA\,A+A^{2}\,dA)=\underbrace{\left((A^{2})^{T}\otimes\Id+A^{T}\otimes A+\Id\otimes A^{2}\right)}_{\text{vectorized Jacobian}}\operatorname{vec}(dX)\,.\]</span> You could go on to find the Jacobians of <span class="math inline">\(A^{4}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A^{5}\)</span>, and so on, or any linear combination of matrix powers. Indeed, you could imagine applying a similar process to the Taylor series of any (analytic) matrix function <span class="math inline">\(f(A)\)</span>, but it starts to become awkward. Later on (and in homework), we will discuss more elegant ways to differentiate other matrix functions, not as vectorized Jacobians but as linear operators on matrices.</p>

<section id="the-computational-cost-of-kronecker-products" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-computational-cost-of-kronecker-products">The computational cost of Kronecker products</h3>
<p>One must be cautious about using Kronecker products as a <em>computational</em> tool, rather than as more of a <em>conceptual</em> tool, because they can easily cause the computational cost of matrix problems to explode far beyond what is necessary.</p>
<p>Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> are all <span class="math inline">\(m\times m\)</span> matrices. The cost of multiplying two <span class="math inline">\(m\times m\)</span> matrices (by the usual methods) scales proportional to <span class="math inline">\(\sim m^{3}\)</span>, what the computer scientists call <span class="math inline">\(\Theta(m^{3})\)</span> “complexity.” Hence, the cost of the linear operation <span class="math inline">\(C\mapsto BCA^{T}\)</span> scales as <span class="math inline">\(\sim m^{3}\)</span> (two <span class="math inline">\(m\times m\)</span> multiplications). However, if we instead compute the <em>same answer</em> via <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{vec}(BCA^{T})=(A\otimes B)\operatorname{vec}C\)</span>, then we must:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Form the <span class="math inline">\(m^{2}\times m^{2}\)</span> matrix <span class="math inline">\(A\otimes B\)</span>. This requires <span class="math inline">\(m^{4}\)</span> multiplications (all entries of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> by all entries of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>), and <span class="math inline">\(\sim m^{4}\)</span> memory storage. (Compare to <span class="math inline">\(\sim m^{2}\)</span> memory to store <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is 1000, this is a <em>million</em> times more storage, terabytes instead of megabytes!)</p></li>
<li><p>Multiply <span class="math inline">\(A\otimes B\)</span> by the vector <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{vec}C\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(m^{2}\)</span> entries. Multiplying an <span class="math inline">\(n\times n\)</span> matrix by a vector requires <span class="math inline">\(\sim n^{2}\)</span> operations, and here <span class="math inline">\(n=m^{2}\)</span>, so this is again <span class="math inline">\(\sim m^{4}\)</span> arithmetic operations.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>So, instead of <span class="math inline">\(\sim m^{3}\)</span> operations and <span class="math inline">\(\sim m^{2}\)</span> storage to compute <span class="math inline">\(BCA^{T}\)</span>, using <span class="math inline">\((A\otimes B)\operatorname{vec}C\)</span> requires <span class="math inline">\(\sim m^{4}\)</span> operations and <span class="math inline">\(\sim m^{4}\)</span> storage, vastly worse! Essentially, this is because <span class="math inline">\(A\otimes B\)</span> has a lot of structure that we are not exploiting (it is a <em>very special</em> <span class="math inline">\(m^{2}\times m^{2}\)</span> matrix).</p>
<p>There are many examples of this nature. Another famous one involves solving the linear <em>matrix</em> equations <span class="math display">\[AX+XB=C\]</span> for an unknown matrix <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, given <span class="math inline">\(A,B,C\)</span>, where all of these are <span class="math inline">\(m\times m\)</span> matrices. This is called a “Sylvester equation.” These are <em>linear</em> equations in our unknown <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, and we can convert them to an ordinary system of <span class="math inline">\(m^{2}\)</span> linear equations by Kronecker products: <span class="math display">\[\operatorname{vec}(AX+XB)=(\Id\otimes A+B^{T}\otimes\Id)\operatorname{vec}X=\operatorname{vec}C,\]</span> which you can then solve for the <span class="math inline">\(m^{2}\)</span> unknowns <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{vec}X\)</span> using Gaussian elimination. But the cost of solving an <span class="math inline">\(m^{2}\times m^{2}\)</span> system of equations by Gaussian elimination is <span class="math inline">\(\sim (m^2)^3 = m^{6}\)</span>. It turns out, however, that there are clever algorithms to solve <span class="math inline">\(AX+XB=C\)</span> in only <span class="math inline">\(\sim m^{3}\)</span> operations (with <span class="math inline">\(\sim m^{2}\)</span> memory)—for <span class="math inline">\(m=1000\)</span>, this saves a factor of <span class="math inline">\(\sim m^3 = {10}^9\)</span> (a <em>billion</em>) in computational effort.</p>
<p>(Kronecker products can be a more practical computational tool for <em>sparse</em> matrices: matrices that are mostly zero, e.g.&nbsp;having only a few nonzero entries per row. That’s because the Kronecker product of two sparse matrices is also sparse, avoiding the huge storage requirements for Kronecker products of non-sparse “dense” matrices. This can be a convenient way to assemble large sparse systems of equations for things like multidimensional PDEs.)</p>

<h1>Finite-Difference Approximations</h1>
<p>In this section, we will be referring to this <a href="https://github.com/mitmath/matrixcalc/blob/main/notes/Finite%20difference%20checks.ipynb">Julia notebook</a> for calculations that are not included here.</p>
<section id="sec:approximation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec:approximation">Why compute derivatives approximately instead of exactly?</h2>
<p>Working out derivatives by hand is a notoriously error-prone procedure for complicated functions. Even if every individual step is straightforward, there are so many opportunities to make a mistake, either in the derivation or in its implementation on a computer. Whenever you implement a derivatives, you should <strong>always double-check</strong> for mistakes by comparing it to an independent calculation. The simplest such check is a <em>finite-difference approximation</em>, in which we <em>estimate</em> the derivative(s) by comparing <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f(x + \delta x)\)</span> for one or more “finite” (non-infinitesimal) perturbations <span class="math inline">\(\delta x\)</span>.</p>
<p>There are many finite-difference techniques at varying levels of sophistication, as we will discuss below. They all incur an intrinsic <strong>truncation error</strong> due to the fact that <span class="math inline">\(\delta x\)</span> is not infinitesimal. (And we will also see that you can’t make <span class="math inline">\(\delta x\)</span> too small, either, or <em>roundoff errors</em> start exploding!) Moreover, finite differences become expensive for higher-dimensional <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (in which you need a separate finite difference for each input dimension to compute the full Jacobian). This makes them an approach of last resort for computing derivatives accurately. On the other hand, they are the <em>first</em> method you generally employ in order to <em>check</em> derivatives: if you have a bug in your analytical derivative calculation, usually the answer is completely wrong, so even a crude finite-difference approximation for a single small <span class="math inline">\(\delta x\)</span> (chosen at random in higher dimensions) will typically reveal the problem.</p>
<p>Another alternative is <strong>automatic differentiation</strong> (AD), software/compilers perform <em>analytical</em> derivatives for you. This is extremely reliable and, with modern AD software, can be very efficient. Unfortunately, there is still lots of code, e.g.&nbsp;code calling external libraries in other languages, that AD tools can’t comprehend. And there are other cases where AD is inefficient, typically because it misses some mathematical structure of the problem. Even in such cases, you can often fix AD by defining the derivative of one small piece of your program by hand,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> which is much easier than differentiating the whole thing. In such cases, you still will typically want a finite-difference check to ensure that you have not made a mistake.</p>
<p>It turns out that finite-difference approximations are a surprisingly complicated subject, with rich connections to many areas of numerical analysis; in this lecture we will just scratch the surface.</p>
</section>
<section id="finite-difference-approximations-easy-version" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="finite-difference-approximations-easy-version">Finite-Difference Approximations: Easy Version</h2>
<p>The simplest way to check a derivative is to recall that the definition of a differential: <span class="math display">\[df = f(x+dx) - f(x) = f'(x) dx\]</span> came from dropping higher-order terms from a small but finite difference: <span class="math display">\[\delta f = f(x+\delta x) - f(x) = f'(x) \delta x + o(\Vert \delta x \Vert) \, .\]</span> So, we can just compare the <strong>finite difference</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\boxed{f(x+\delta x) - f(x)}\)</span> to our <strong>(directional) derivative operator</strong> <span class="math inline">\(f'(x) \delta x\)</span> (i.e.&nbsp;the derivative in the direction <span class="math inline">\(\delta x\)</span>). <span class="math inline">\(f(x+\delta x) - f(x)\)</span> is also called a <strong>forward difference</strong> approximation. The antonym of a forward difference is a <strong>backward difference</strong> approximation <span class="math inline">\(f(x) - f(x - \delta x) \approx f'(x) \delta x\)</span>. If you just want to compute a derivative, there is not much practical distinction between forward and backward differences. The distinction becomes more important when discretizing (approximating) differential equations. We’ll look at other possibilities below.</p>
<div class="proof remark">
<p><span class="proof-title"><em>Remark</em>. </span>Note that this definition of forward and backward difference is <strong>not</strong> the same as forward- and backward-mode differentiation—these are <strong>unrelated</strong> concepts.</p>
</div>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is a scalar, we can also divide both sides by <span class="math inline">\(\delta x\)</span> to get an approximation for <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)\)</span> instead of for <span class="math inline">\(df\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[f'(x) \approx \frac{f(x+\delta x) - f(x)}{\delta x} + \text{(higher-order corrections)} \, .\]</span> This is a more common way to write the forward-difference approximation, but it only works for scalar <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, whereas in this class we want to think of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> as perhaps belonging to some other vector space.</p>
<p>Finite-difference approximations come in many forms, but they are generally a <strong>last resort</strong> in cases where it’s too much effort to work out an analytical derivative and AD fails. But they are also useful to <strong>check</strong> your analytical derivatives and to quickly <strong>explore</strong>.</p>

<section id="example-matrix-squaring" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-matrix-squaring">Example: Matrix squaring</h2>
<p>Let’s try the finite-difference approximation for the square function <span class="math inline">\(f(A) = A^2\)</span>, where here <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is a square matrix in <span class="math inline">\(\R^{m,m}\)</span>. By hand, we obtain the product rule <span class="math display">\[df = A \,dA + dA \, A,\]</span> i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(f'(A)\)</span> is the <strong>linear operator</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\boxed{f'(A)[\delta A] = A \,\delta A + \delta A \,A.}\)</span> This is <em>not equal to</em> <span class="math inline">\(2A \,\delta A\)</span> because <em>in general</em> <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\delta A\)</span> do not commute. So let’s check this difference against a finite difference. We’ll try it for a <em>random</em> input A and a <em>random small</em> perturbation <span class="math inline">\(\delta A\)</span>.</p>
<p>Using a random matrix <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, let <span class="math inline">\(dA = A \cdot 10^{-8}\)</span>. Then, you can compare <span class="math inline">\(f(A+dA) - f(A)\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(A \,dA + dA \, A\)</span>. If the matrix you chose was really random, you would get that the approximation minus the exact equality from the product rule has entries with order of magnitude around <span class="math inline">\(10^{-16}!\)</span> However, compared to <span class="math inline">\(2A dA\)</span>, you’d obtain entries of order <span class="math inline">\(10^{-8}\)</span>.</p>
<p>To be more quantitative, we might compute that "norm" <span class="math inline">\(\lVert \text{approx} - \text{exact} \rVert\)</span> which we want to be small. But small <strong>compared to what</strong>? The natural answer is <strong>small compared to the correct answer.</strong> This is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation_error">relative error</a> (or "fractional error") and is computed via <span class="math display">\[\text{relative error} = \frac{\lVert \text{approx} - \text{exact} \rVert}{\lVert \text{exact} \rVert}.\]</span> Here, <span class="math inline">\(\lVert \cdot \rVert\)</span> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)">norm</a>, like the length of a vector. This allows us to understand the size of the error in the finite difference approximation, i.e.&nbsp;it allows us to answer how accurate this approximation is (recall Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:approximation" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:approximation">4.1</a>).</p>
<p>So, as above, you can compute that the relative error between the approximation and the exact answer is about <span class="math inline">\(10^{-8}\)</span>, where as the relative error between <span class="math inline">\(2A dA\)</span> and the exact answer is about <span class="math inline">\(10^{0}\)</span>. This shows that our exact answer is likely correct! Getting a good match up between a random input and small displacement isn’t a proof of correctness of course, but it is always a good thing to check. This kind of randomized comparison will almost always <strong>catch major bugs</strong> where you have calculated the symbolic derivative incorrectly, like in our <span class="math inline">\(2A dA\)</span> example.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>Note that the norm of a matrix that we are using, computed by <code>norm(A)</code> in Julia, is just the direct analogue of the familiar Euclidean norm for the case of vectors. It is simply the square root of the sum of the matrix entries squared: <span class="math display">\[\lVert A \rVert := \sqrt{\sum_{i,j} |A_{ij}|^2} = \sqrt{\tr (A^T A)} \, .\]</span> This is called the <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/FrobeniusNorm.html">Frobenius norm</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s again consider the example <span class="math inline">\(f(A) = A^2\)</span>, and plot the relative error as a function of <span class="math inline">\(\lVert \delta A \rVert\)</span>.

<p>The <strong>truncation error</strong> is the inaccuracy arising from the fact that the input perturbation <span class="math inline">\(\delta x\)</span> is not infinitesimal: we are computing a difference, not a derivative.

For forward differences, here, the order is <strong>n=1</strong>. Why?</p>
<p>For any <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> with a nonzero second derivative (think of the Taylor series), we have <span class="math display">\[f(x + \delta x) = f(x) + f'(x) \delta x + (\text{terms proportional to }\Vert \delta x \Vert^2) + \underbrace{o(\Vert \delta x \Vert^2)}_\text{i.e. higher-order terms}\]</span> That is, the terms we <em>dropped</em> in our forward-difference approximations are proportional to <span class="math inline">\(\Vert \delta x\Vert^2\)</span>. But that means that the <strong>relative error is linear</strong>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \text{relative error} &amp;= \frac{\Vert f(x+\delta x) - f(x) - f'(x) \delta x \Vert}{\Vert f'(x) \delta x \Vert} \\
    &amp;= \frac{(\text{terms proportional to }\Vert \delta x \Vert^2) + o(\Vert \delta x \Vert^2)}{\text{proportional to }\Vert \delta x \Vert} = (\text{terms proportional to }\Vert \delta x \Vert) + o(\Vert \delta x \Vert)
\end{aligned}\]</span> This is <strong>first-order accuracy</strong>. Truncation error in a finite-difference approximation is the <strong>inherent</strong> error in the formula for <strong>non-infinitesimal</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\delta x\)</span>. Does that mean we should just make <span class="math inline">\(\delta x\)</span> as small as we possibly can?</p>

<section id="roundoff-error" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="roundoff-error">Roundoff error</h2>
<p>The reason why the error <em>increased</em> for very small <span class="math inline">\(\delta A\)</span> was due to <strong>roundoff errors</strong>. The computer only stores a <strong>finite number of significant digits</strong> (about 15 decimal digits) for each real number and rounds off the rest on each operation — this is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic">floating-point arithmetic</a>. If <span class="math inline">\(\delta x\)</span> is too small, then the difference <span class="math inline">\(f(x+\delta x) - f(x)\)</span> gets rounded off to zero (some or all of the <em>significant digits cancel</em>). This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophic_cancellation">catastrophic cancellation</a>.</p>
<p>Floating-point arithmetic is much like scientific notation <span class="math inline">\({*}.{*}{*}{*}{*}{*} \times 10^e\)</span>: a finite-precision coefficient <span class="math inline">\({*}.{*}{*}{*}{*}{*}\)</span> scaled by a power of&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> (or, on a computer, a power of&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>). The number of digits in the coefficient (the “significant digits”) is the “precision,” which in the usual 64-bit floating-point arithmetic is charactized by a quantity <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon = 2^{-52} \approx 2.22 \times 10^{-16}\)</span>, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_epsilon">machine epsilon</a>. When an arbitrary real number <span class="math inline">\(y \in \mathbb{R}\)</span> is rounded to the closest floating-point value <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{y}\)</span>, the roundoff error is bounded by <span class="math inline">\(|\tilde{y} - y| \le \epsilon |y|\)</span>. Equivalently, the computer keeps only about 15–16 <span class="math inline">\(\approx -\log_{10} \epsilon\)</span> decimal digits, or really <span class="math inline">\(53 = 1 - \log_2 \epsilon\)</span> <em>binary</em> digits, for each number.</p>
<p>In our finite-difference example, for <span class="math inline">\(\Vert \delta A \Vert / \Vert A \Vert\)</span> of roughly <span class="math inline">\(10^{-8} \approx \sqrt{\epsilon} \lVert A\rVert\)</span> or larger, the approximation for <span class="math inline">\(f'(A)\)</span> is dominated by the truncation error, but if we go smaller than that the relative error starts increasing due to roundoff. Experience has shown that <span class="math inline">\(\Vert \delta x \Vert \approx \sqrt{\epsilon} \Vert x \Vert\)</span> is often a good rule of thumb—about half the significant digits is the most that is reasonably safe to rely on—but the precise crossover point of minimum error depends on the function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and the finite-difference method. But, like all rules of thumb, this may not always be completely reliable.</p>
</section>
<section id="other-finite-difference-methods" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="other-finite-difference-methods">Other finite-difference methods</h2>
<p>There are more sophisticated finite-difference methods, such as Richardson extrapolation, which consider a sequence of progressively smaller <span class="math inline">\(\delta x\)</span> values in order to adaptively determine the best possible estimate for <span class="math inline">\(f'\)</span> (<em>extrapolating</em> to <span class="math inline">\(\delta x \to 0\)</span> using progressively higher degree polynomials). One can also use higher-order difference formulas than the simple forward-difference method here, so that the truncation error decreases faster than than linearly with <span class="math inline">\(\delta x\)</span>. The most famous higher-order formula is the “centered difference” <span class="math inline">\(f'(x) \delta x \approx [f(x + \delta x) - f(x - \delta x)]/2\)</span>, which has <em>second</em>-order accuracy (relative truncation error proportional to <span class="math inline">\(\Vert \delta x\Vert^2\)</span>).</p>
<p>Higher-dimensional inputs <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> pose a fundamental computational challenge for finite-difference techniques, because if you want to know what happens for every possible direction <span class="math inline">\(\delta x\)</span> then you need many finite differences: one for each dimension of <span class="math inline">\(\delta x\)</span>. For example, suppose <span class="math inline">\(x \in \mathbb{R}^n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \in \mathbb{R}\)</span>, so that you are computing <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f \in \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>; if you want to know the whole gradient, you need <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> <em>separate</em> finite differences. The net result is that finite differences in higher dimensions are expensive, quickly becoming impractical for high-dimensional optimization (e.g.&nbsp;neural networks) where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> might be huge. On the other hand, if you are just using finite differences as a check for bugs in your code, it is usually sufficient to compare <span class="math inline">\(f(x+\delta x) - f(x)\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)[\delta x]\)</span> in a few random directions, i.e.&nbsp;for a few random small <span class="math inline">\(\delta x\)</span>.</p>

<section id="sec:generalvectorspaces" class="level1">
<h1>Derivatives in General Vector Spaces</h1>
<p>Matrix calculus requires us to generalize concepts of derivative and gradient further, to functions whose inputs and/or outputs are not simply scalars or column vectors. To achieve this, we extend the notion of the ordinary vector <strong>dot product</strong> and ordinary Euclidean vector “length” to general <strong>inner products</strong> and <strong>norms</strong> on <strong>vector spaces</strong>. Our first example will consider familiar matrices from this point of view.</p>
<p>Recall from linear algebra that we can call any set <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> a “vector space” if its elements can be added/subtracted <span class="math inline">\(x \pm y\)</span> and multiplied by scalars <span class="math inline">\(\alpha x\)</span> (subject to some basic arithmetic axioms, e.g.&nbsp;the distributive law). For example, the set of <span class="math inline">\(m \times n\)</span> matrices themselves form a vector space, or even the set of continuous functions <span class="math inline">\(u(x)\)</span> (mapping <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\)</span>)—the key fact is that we can add/subtract/scale them and get elements of the same set. It turns out to be extraordinarily useful to extend differentiation to such spaces, e.g.&nbsp;for functions that map matrices to matrices or functions to numbers. Doing so crucially relies on our input/output vector spaces <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> having a <strong>norm</strong> and, ideally, an <strong>inner product</strong>.</p>
<section id="a-simple-matrix-dot-product-and-norm" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-simple-matrix-dot-product-and-norm">A Simple Matrix Dot Product and Norm</h2>
<p>Recall that for <em>scalar-valued</em> functions <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \in \R\)</span> with <em>vector inputs</em> <span class="math inline">\(x\in \R^n\)</span> (i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-component “column vectors") we have that <span class="math display">\[df = f(x + dx) - f(x) = f'(x) [dx] \in \R.\]</span> Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)\)</span> is a linear operator taking in the vector <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> in and giving a scalar value out. Another way to view this is that <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)\)</span> is the row vector<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> <span class="math inline">\((\nabla f)^T\)</span>. Under this viewpoint, it follows that <span class="math inline">\(df\)</span> is the dot product (or”inner product”): <span class="math display">\[df = \nabla f \cdot dx\]</span></p>
<p>We can generalize this to any vector space <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> with inner products! Given <span class="math inline">\(x\in V\)</span>, and a scalar-valued function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, we obtain the linear operator <span class="math inline">\(f'(x) [dx] \in \R\)</span>, called a “linear form.” In order to define the gradient <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span>, we need an inner product for <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, the vector-space generalization of the familiar dot product!</p>
<p>Given <span class="math inline">\(x,y \in V\)</span>, the inner product <span class="math inline">\(\langle x, y \rangle\)</span> is a map (<span class="math inline">\(\cdot\)</span>) such that <span class="math inline">\(\langle x, y \rangle \in \R\)</span>. This is also commonly denoted <span class="math inline">\(x \cdot y\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\langle x \mid y \rangle\)</span>. More technically, an inner product is a map that is</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Symmetric</strong>: i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(\langle x, y \rangle = \langle y, x \rangle\)</span> (or conjugate-symmetric,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> <span class="math inline">\(\langle x, y \rangle = \overline{\langle y, x \rangle}\)</span>, if we were using complex numbers),</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Linear</strong>: i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(\langle x, \alpha y + \beta z\rangle = \alpha \langle x, y \rangle + \beta \langle x, z \rangle\)</span>, and</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Non-negative</strong>: i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(\langle x, x \rangle := \lVert x \rVert^2 \geq 0\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(=0\)</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">\(x = 0\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the combination of the first two properties means that it must also be linear in the left vector (or conjugate-linear, if we were using complex numbers). Another useful consequence of these three properties, which is a bit trickier to derive, is the <em>Cauchy–Schwarz inequality</em> <span class="math inline">\(|\langle x, y \rangle| \le \Vert x \Vert \, \Vert y \Vert\)</span>.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>A (complete) vector space with an inner product is called a <em>Hilbert space</em>. (The technical requirement of “completeness” essentially means that you can take limits in the space, and is important for rigorous proofs.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>)</p>
</div>
<p>Once we have a Hilbert space, we can define the gradient for scalar-valued functions. Given <span class="math inline">\(x\in V\)</span> a Hilbert space, and <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> scalar, then we have the linear form <span class="math inline">\(f'(x) [dx] \in \R\)</span>. Then, under these assumptions, there is a theorem known as the “Riesz representation theorem” stating that <em>any</em> linear form (including <span class="math inline">\(f'\)</span>) must be an inner product with <em>something</em>: <span class="math display">\[f'(x) [dx] = \big\langle \underbrace{\text{(some vector)}}_{\text{gradient } \nabla f\bigr|_x} , dx \big\rangle = df.\]</span> That is, the gradient <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span> is <em>defined</em> as the thing you take the inner product of <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> with to get <span class="math inline">\(df\)</span>. Note that <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span> always has the “same shape” as <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<p>The first few examples we look at involve the usual Hilbert space <span class="math inline">\(V = \R^n\)</span> with different inner products.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Given <span class="math inline">\(V = \R^n\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-column vectors, we have the familiar Euclidean dot product <span class="math inline">\(\langle x, y \rangle = x^T y\)</span>. This leads to the usual <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>We can have different inner products on <span class="math inline">\(\R^n\)</span>. For instance, <span class="math display">\[\langle x, y\rangle_W = w_1 x_1 y_1 + w_2 x_2 y_2 + \dots w_n x_n y_n = x^T \underbrace{\begin{pmatrix}
        w_1 &amp; &amp; \\
         &amp; \ddots &amp; \\
         &amp; &amp; w_n
    \end{pmatrix}}_{W} y\]</span> for weights <span class="math inline">\(w_1,\dots, w_n &gt;0\)</span>.</p>
<p>More generally we can define a weighted dot product <span class="math inline">\(\langle x, y\rangle_W= x^T W y\)</span> for any symmetric-positive-definite matrix <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(W = W^T\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is positive definite, which is sufficient for this to be a valid inner product).</p>
<p>If we change the definition of the inner product, then we change the definition of the gradient! For example, with <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = x^T A x\)</span> we previously found that <span class="math inline">\(df = x^T (A + A^T) dx\)</span>. With the ordinary Euclidean inner product, this gave a gradient <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f = (A+A^T)x\)</span>. However, if we use the weighted inner product <span class="math inline">\(x^T W y\)</span>, then we would obtain a different “gradient” <span class="math inline">\(\nabla^{(W)} f = W^{-1} (A+A^T)x\)</span> so that <span class="math inline">\(df = \langle \nabla^{(W)}  f , dx \rangle\)</span>.</p>
<p>In these notes, we will employ the Euclidean inner product for <span class="math inline">\(x \in \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>, and hence the usual <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span>, unless noted otherwise. However, weighted inner products are useful in lots of cases, especially when the components of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> have different scales/units.</p>
</div>
<p>We can also consider the space of <span class="math inline">\(m\times n\)</span> matrices <span class="math inline">\(V = \R^{m \times n}\)</span>. There, is of course, a vector-space isomorphism from <span class="math inline">\(V \ni A \to \mathrm{vec}(A) \in \R^{mn}\)</span>. Thus, in this space we have the analogue of the familiar (“Frobenius") Euclidean inner product, which is convenient to rewrite in terms of matrix operations via the trace:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>The <strong>Frobenius inner product</strong> of two <span class="math inline">\(m \times n\)</span> matrices <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is: <span class="math display">\[\langle A, B \rangle_F = \sum_{ij} A_{ij} B_{ij} = \mathrm{vec}(A)^T \mathrm{vec}(B) = \tr(A^T B) \, .\]</span> Given this inner product, we also have the corresponding <strong>Frobenius norm</strong>: <span class="math display">\[\lVert A \rVert_F = \sqrt{\langle A,A \rangle_F} = \sqrt{\tr(A^TA)} = \lVert \mathrm{vec} A\rVert = \sqrt{\sum_{i,j} |A_{ij}|^2} \, .\]</span> Using this, we can now define the gradient of scalar functions with <em>matrix inputs</em>! This will be our default matrix inner product (hence defining our default matrix gradient) in these notes (sometimes dropping the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> subscript).</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider the function <span class="math display">\[f(A) = \lVert A \rVert_F = \sqrt{\tr(A^T A)}.\]</span> What is <span class="math inline">\(df\)</span>?</p>
</div>
<p>Firstly, by the familiar scalar-differentiation chain and power rules we have that <span class="math display">\[df = \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{\tr(A^T A)}} d(\tr A^T A).\]</span> Then, note that (by linearity of the trace) <span class="math display">\[d( \tr B) = \tr(B+dB) - \tr(B) = \tr(B) + \tr(dB) - \tr(B) = \tr(dB).\]</span> Hence, <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    df &amp;= \frac{1}{2\lVert A\rVert_F} \tr(d(A^T A)) \\
    &amp;= \frac{1}{2\lVert A\rVert_F} \tr( dA^T\, A + A^T\, dA) \\
    &amp;= \frac{1}{2 \lVert A\rVert_F} (\tr(dA^T\, A) + \tr(A^T\, dA)) \\
    &amp;= \frac{1}{\lVert A\rVert_F} \tr(A^T \, dA) = \big\langle \frac{A}{\lVert A\rVert_F} , dA \big\rangle.
\end{aligned}\]</span> Here, we used the fact that <span class="math inline">\(\tr B = \tr B^T\)</span>, and in the last step we connected <span class="math inline">\(df\)</span> with a Frobenius inner product. In other words, <span class="math display">\[\nabla f = \nabla \lVert A \rVert_F = \frac{A}{\lVert A \rVert_F}.\]</span> Note that one obtains exactly the same result for column vectors&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(\nabla \Vert x\Vert = x/\Vert x \Vert\)</span> (and in fact this is equivalent via <span class="math inline">\(x = \operatorname{vec}A\)</span>).</p>
<p>Let’s consider another simple example:</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Fix some constant <span class="math inline">\(x \in \R^m\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y\in \R^n\)</span>, and consider the function <span class="math inline">\(f:\R^{m\times n} \to \R\)</span> given by <span class="math display">\[f(A) = x^T A y.\]</span> What is <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span>?</p>
</div>
<p>We have that <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    df &amp;= x^T \,dA \,y \\
    &amp;= \tr( x^T \,dA\, y) \\
    &amp;= \tr(y x^T \, dA) \\
    &amp;= \big\langle \underbrace{x y^T}_{\nabla f} , \, dA \big\rangle.
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>More generally, for any scalar-valued function <span class="math inline">\(f(A)\)</span>, from the definition of Frobenius inner product it follows that: <span class="math display">\[df = f(A+dA)-f(A) = \langle \nabla f , \, dA \rangle = \sum_{i,j} (\nabla f)_{i,j} \, dA_{i,j} \, ,\]</span> and hence the components of the gradient are exactly the elementwise derivatives <span class="math display">\[(\nabla f)_{i,j} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial A_{i,j}} \, ,\]</span> similar to the component-wise definition of the gradient vector from multivariable calculus! But for non-trivial matrix-input functions <span class="math inline">\(f(A)\)</span> it can be extremely awkward to take the derivative with respect to each entry of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> individually. Using the “holistic” matrix inner-product definition, we will soon be able to compute even more complicated matrix-valued gradients, including <span class="math inline">\(\nabla (\det A)\)</span>!</p>

<section id="sec:banach" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec:banach">Derivatives, Norms, and Banach spaces</h2>
<p>We have been using the term “norm” throughout this class, but what technically is a norm?

It turns out, in fact, that norms are crucial to the definition of a derivative!</p>
<p>Given a vector space <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, a norm <span class="math inline">\(\lVert \cdot \rVert\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is a map <span class="math inline">\(\lVert \cdot \rVert: V\to \R\)</span> satisfying the following three properties:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Non-negative</strong>: i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(\lVert v \rVert \geq 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lVert v \rVert = 0 \iff v = 0\)</span>,</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Homogeneity</strong>: <span class="math inline">\(\lVert \alpha v \rVert = |\alpha |\lVert v \rVert\)</span> for any <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in \R\)</span>, and</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Triangle inequality</strong>: <span class="math inline">\(\lVert u + v\rVert \leq \lVert u \rVert + \lVert v \rVert\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A vector space that has a norm is called an <em>normed vector space</em>. Often, mathematicians technically want a slightly more precise type of normed vector space with a less obvious name: a <em>Banach</em> space.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>A (complete) vector space with a norm is called a <em>Banach space</em>. (As with Hilbert spaces, “completeness” is a technical requirement for some types of rigorous analysis, essentially allowing you to take limits.)</p>
</div>
<p>For example, given any inner product <span class="math inline">\(\langle u , v \rangle\)</span>, there is a corresponding norm <span class="math inline">\(\lVert u \rVert = \sqrt{\langle u , u \rangle}\)</span>. (Thus, every Hilbert space is also a Banach space.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>)</p>
<p>To define derivatives, we technically need both the input <em>and</em> the output to be Banach spaces. To see this, recall our formalism <span class="math display">\[f(x + \delta x) - f(x) = \underbrace{f'(x) [\delta x]}_{\mbox{linear}} \; + \underbrace{o(\delta x)}_{\mbox{smaller}}\, .\]</span> To precisely define the sense in which the <span class="math inline">\(o(\delta x)\)</span> terms are “smaller” or “higher-order,” we need norms. In particular, the “little-<span class="math inline">\(o\)</span>” notation <span class="math inline">\(o(\delta x)\)</span> denotes any function such that <span class="math display">\[\lim_{\delta x\to 0} \frac{\lVert o (\delta x) \rVert}{\lVert \delta x\rVert} = 0 \, ,\]</span> i.e.&nbsp;which goes to zero faster than linearly in <span class="math inline">\(\delta x\)</span>.

<section id="sec:newton-roots" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec:newton-roots">Newton’s Method</h2>
<p>One common application of derivatives is to solve nonlinear equations via linearization.</p>
<section id="scalar-functions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scalar-functions">Scalar Functions</h3>
<p>For instance, suppose we have a scalar function <span class="math inline">\(f: \R \to \R\)</span> and we wanted to solve <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = 0\)</span> for a root&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Of course, we could solve such an equation explicitly in simple cases, such as when <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is linear or quadratic, but if the function is something more arbitrary like <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = x^3 - \sin (\cos x)\)</span> you might not be able to obtain closed-form solutions. However, there is a nice way to obtain the solution approximately to any accuracy you want, as long if you know approximately where the root is. The method we are talking about is known as <em>Newton’s method</em>, which is really a linear-algebra technique. It takes in the function and a guess for the root, approximates it by a straight line (whose root is easy to find), which is then an approximate root that we can use as a new guess. In particular, the method (depicted in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:newton-step" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:newton-step">4</a>) is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Linearize <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> near some <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> using the approximation <span class="math display">\[f(x + \delta x) \approx f(x) + f'(x) \delta x,\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>solve the linear equation <span class="math inline">\(f(x) + f'(x) \delta x = 0 \implies \delta x = -\frac{f(x)}{f'(x)}\)</span>,</p></li>
<li><p>and then use this to update the value of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> we linearized near—i.e.,&nbsp;letting the new <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> be <span class="math display">\[x_\text{new} = x - \delta x = x + \frac{f(x)}{f'(x)} \, .\]</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you are close to the root, Newton’s method converges amazingly quickly. As discussed below, it asymptotically <em>doubles</em> the number of correct digits on every step!</p>
<p>One may ask what happens when <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)\)</span> is not invertible, for instance here if <span class="math inline">\(f'(x) = 0\)</span>. If this happens, then Newton’s method may break down! See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method#Failure_analysis">here</a> for examples of when Newton’s method breaks down.</p>

<p>We can generalize Newton’s method to multidimensional functions! Let <span class="math inline">\(f: \R^n \to \R^n\)</span> be a function which takes in a vector and spits out a vector of the same size&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. We can then apply a Newton approach in higher dimensions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Linearize <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> near some <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> using the first-derivative approximation <span class="math display">\[f(x + \delta x) \approx f(x) + \underbrace{f'(x)}_\text{Jacobian} \delta x,\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>solve the linear equation <span class="math inline">\(f(x) + f'(x) \delta x = 0 \implies \delta x = -\underbrace{f'(x)^{-1}}_\text{inverse Jacobian} f(x)\)</span>,</p></li>
<li><p>and then use this to update the value of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> we linearized near—i.e.,&nbsp;letting the new <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> be <span class="math display">\[x_\text{new} = x_\text{old} - f'(x)^{-1}f(x)\, .\]</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it! Once we have the Jacobian, we can just solve a linear system on each step. This again converges amazingly fast, doubling the number of digits of accuracy in each step. (This is known as “quadratic convergence.”) However, there is a caveat: we <em>need</em> some starting guess for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, and the guess needs to be sufficiently close to the root for the algorithm to make reliable progress. (If you start with an initial <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> far from a root, Newton’s method can fail to converge and/or it can jump around in intricate and surprising ways—google “Newton fractal” for some fascinating examples.) This is a widely used and very practical application of Jacobians and derivatives!</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="nonlinear-optimization">Nonlinear Optimization</h3>
<p>A perhaps even more famous application of large-scale differentiation is to nonlinear optimization. Suppose we have a scalar-valued function <span class="math inline">\(f: \R^n \to \R\)</span>, and suppose we want to minimize (or maximize) <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. For instance, in machine learning, we could have a big neural network (NN) with a vector <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> of a million parameters, and one tries to minimize a “loss” function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> that compares the NN output to the desired results on “training” data. The most basic idea in optimization is to go “downhill” (see diagram) to make <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> as small as possible. If we can take the gradient of this function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, to go “downhill” we consider <span class="math inline">\(- \nabla f\)</span>, the direction of <em>steepest descent</em>, as depicted in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:steepest-descent" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:steepest-descent">5</a>.</p>
<div id="fig:steepest-descent" class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center anchored">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="figures/steepest-descent.pdf.svg" class="img-fluid figure-img" style="width:70.0%"></p>
<figcaption>A <em>steepest-descent algorithm</em> minimizes a function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> by taking successive “downhill” steps in the direction <span class="math inline">\(-\nabla f\)</span>. (In the example shown here, we are minimizing a quadratic function in two dimensions <span class="math inline">\(x \in \mathbb{R}^2\)</span>, performing an exact 1d minimization in the downhill direction for each step.) Steepest-descent algorithms can sometimes “zig-zag” along narrow valleys, slowing convergence (which can be counteracted in more sophisticated algorithms by “momentum” terms, second-derivative information, and so on).</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Then, even if we have a million parameters, we can evolve all of them simultaneously in the downhill direction. It turns out that calculating all million derivatives costs about the same as evaluating the function at a point once (using reverse-mode/adjoint/left-to-right/backpropagation methods). Ultimately, this makes large-scale optimization practical for training neural nets, optimizing shapes of airplane wings, optimizing portfolios, etc.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many practical complications that make nonlinear optimization tricky (far more than can be covered in a single lecture, or even in a whole course!), but we give some examples here.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For instance, even though we can compute the “downhill direction”, how far do we need to step in that direction? (In machine learning, this is sometimes called the “learning rate.”) Often, you want to take “as big of a step as you can” to speed convergence, but you don’t want the step to be too big because <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span> only tells you a <em>local</em> approximation of&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. There are many different ideas of how to determine this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Line search: using a 1D minimization to determine how far to step.</p></li>
<li><p>A “trust region” bounding the step size (where we trust the derivative-based approximation of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>). There are many techniques to evolve the size of the trust region as optimization progresses.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>We may also need to consider constraints, for instance minimizing <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> subject to <span class="math inline">\(g_k(x) \leq 0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(h_k(x)=0\)</span>, known as inequality/equality constraints. Points <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> satisfying the constraints are called “feasible”. One typically uses a combination of <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\nabla g_k\)</span> to approximate (e.g.&nbsp;linearize) the problem and make progress towards the best feasible point.</p></li>
<li><p>If you just go straight downhill, you might “zig-zag” along narrow valleys, making convergence very slow. There are a few options to combat this, such as “momentum” terms and conjugate gradients. Even fancier than these techniques, one might estimate second-derivative “Hessian matrices” from a sequence of <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span> values—a famous version of this is known as the BFGS algorithm—and use the Hessian to take approximate Newton steps (for the root <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f = 0\)</span>). (We’ll return to Hessians in a later lecture.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ultimately, there are a lot of techniques and a zoo of competing algorithms that you might need to experiment with to find the best approach for a given problem. (There are many books on optimization algorithms, and even a whole book can only cover a small slice of what is out there!)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Some parting advice: Often the main trick is less about the choice of algorithms than it is about finding the right mathematical formulation of your <em>problem</em>—e.g.&nbsp;what function, what constraints, and what parameters should you be considering—to match your problem to a good algorithm. However, if you have <em>many</em> (<span class="math inline">\(\gg 10\)</span>) parameters, <em>try hard</em> to use an analytical gradient (not finite differences), computed efficiently in reverse mode.</p>

<section id="engineeringphysical-optimization" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="engineeringphysical-optimization">Engineering/Physical Optimization</h3>
<p>There are many, many applications of optimization besides machine learning (fitting models to data). It is interesting to also consider engineering/physical optimization. (For instance, suppose you want to make an airplane wing that is as strong as possible.) The general outline of such problems is typically:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>You start with some design parameters <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{p}\)</span>, e.g.&nbsp;describing the geometry, materials, forces, or other degrees of freedom.</p></li>
<li><p>These <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{p}\)</span> are then used in some physical model(s), such as solid mechanics, chemical reactions, heat transport, electromagnetism, acoustics, etc. For example, you might have a linear model of the form <span class="math inline">\(A(\mathbf{p}) x = b(\mathbf{p})\)</span> for some matrix <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> (typically very large and sparse).</p></li>
<li><p>The solution of the physical model is a solution <span class="math inline">\(x(\mathbf{p})\)</span>. For example, this could be the mechanical stresses, chemical concentrations, temperatures, electromagnetic fields, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The physical solution <span class="math inline">\(x(\mathbf{p})\)</span> is the input into some design objective <span class="math inline">\(f(x(\mathbf{p}))\)</span> that you want to improve/optimize. For instance, strength, speed power, efficiency, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>To maximize/minimize <span class="math inline">\(f(x(\mathbf{p}))\)</span>, one uses the gradient <span class="math inline">\(\nabla_{\mathbf{p}}f\)</span>, computed using reverse-mode/“adjoint” methods, to update the parameters <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{p}\)</span> and improve the design.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As a fun example, researchers have even applied “topology optimization” to design a chair, optimizing every voxel of the design—the parameters <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{p}\)</span> represent the material present (or not) in every voxel, so that the optimization discovers not just an optimal shape but an optimal <em>topology</em> (how materials are connected in space, how many holes there are, and so forth)—to support a given weight with <em>minimal material</em>. To see it in action, watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJ_nSSBl040&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2F&amp;embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com&amp;source_ve_path=Mjg2NjY&amp;feature=emb_logo">chair-optimization video</a>. (People have applied such techniques to much more practical problems as well, from airplane wings to optical communications.)</p>

<section id="sec:adjoint-method" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec:adjoint-method">Reverse-mode “Adjoint” Differentiation</h2>
<p>But what is adjoint differentiation—the method of differentiating that makes these applications actually feasible to solve? Ultimately, it is yet another example of left-to-right/reverse-mode differentiation, essentially applying the chain rule from outputs to inputs. Consider, for example, trying to compute the gradient <span class="math inline">\(\nabla g\)</span> of the scalar-valued function <span class="math display">\[g(p) = f(\underbrace{A(p)^{-1} b}_x) \, .\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> solves <span class="math inline">\(A(p) x  = b\)</span> (e.g.&nbsp;a parameterized physical model as in the previous section) and <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is a scalar-valued function of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (e.g.&nbsp;an optimization objective depending on our physics solution). For example, this could arise in an optimization problem <span class="math display">\[\min_p g(p) \Longleftrightarrow \substack{  \text{ \normalsize  $\displaystyle \min_p f(x)$} \\ \text{ subject to } A(p)x = b }\; ,\]</span> for which the gradient <span class="math inline">\(\nabla g\)</span> would be helpful to search for a local minimum. The chain rule for <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> corresponds to the following conceptual chain of dependencies: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\text{change $dg$ in $g$} &amp;\longleftarrow
\text{change $dx$ in $x = A^{-1} b$}  \\
&amp;\longleftarrow \text{change $d(A^{-1})$ in $A^{-1}$} \\
&amp;\longleftarrow
\text{change $dA$ in $A(p)$}  \\
&amp;\longleftarrow \text{change $dp$ in $p$}
\end{aligned}\]</span> which is expressed by the equations: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
dg &amp;= f'(x) [dx] &amp;\text{ } &amp; dg \longleftarrow dx    \\
&amp; = f'(x) [d(A^{-1}) b] &amp;\text{ } &amp; dx \longleftarrow d(A^{-1})   \\
&amp; = - \underbrace{f'(x) A^{-1}}_{v^T} dA \, A^{-1} b &amp;\text{ } &amp; dA^{-1} \longleftarrow dA \\
&amp; = - v^T \underbrace{A'(p)[dp]}_{dA} \, A^{-1} b &amp;\text{ } &amp;dA \longleftarrow dp \, .
\end{aligned}\]</span> Here, we are defining the row vector <span class="math inline">\(v^T = f'(x) A^{-1}\)</span>, and we have used the differential of a matrix inverse <span class="math inline">\(d(A^{-1})=-A^{-1}\,dA\,A^{-1}\)</span> from Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:jacobian-inverse" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:jacobian-inverse">7.3</a>.</p>
<p>Grouping the terms left-to-right, we first solve the “adjoint” (transposed) equation <span class="math inline">\(A^T v = f'(x)^T = \nabla_x f\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, and then we obtain <span class="math inline">\(dg = - v^T dA \, x\)</span>. Because the derivative <span class="math inline">\(A'(p)\)</span> of a matrix with respect to a vector is awkward to write explicitly, it is convenient to examine this object one parameter at a time. For any given parameter <span class="math inline">\(p_k\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\partial g/\partial p_k = -v^T (\partial A/\partial p_k) x\)</span> (and in many applications <span class="math inline">\(\partial A /\partial p_k\)</span> is very sparse); here, “dividing by” <span class="math inline">\(\partial p_k\)</span> works because this is a scalar factor that commutes with the other linear operations. That is, it takes only <em>two solves</em> to get both <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\nabla g\)</span>: one for solving <span class="math inline">\(A x = b\)</span> to find <span class="math inline">\(g(p)=f(x)\)</span>, and another with <span class="math inline">\(A^T\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, after which all of the derivatives <span class="math inline">\(\partial g/\partial p_k\)</span> are just some cheap dot products.</p>
<p>Note that you should <strong><em>not</em></strong> use right-to-left “forward-mode” derivatives with lots of parameters, because <span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial g}{\partial p_k} = - f'(x) \left(A^{-1} \frac{\partial A}{\partial p_k}x\right)\]</span> represents one solve per parameter <span class="math inline">\(p_k\)</span>! As discussed in Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:forward-vs-reverse" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:forward-vs-reverse">8.4</a>, right-to-left (a.k.a.&nbsp;forward mode) is better when there is one (or few) input parameters <span class="math inline">\(p_k\)</span> and many outputs, while left-to-right “adjoint” differentiation (a.k.a.&nbsp;reverse mode) is better when there is one (or few) output values and many input parameters. (In Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:dual-AD" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:dual-AD">8.1</a>, we will discuss using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_number">dual numbers</a> for differentiation, and this also corresponds to forward mode.)</p>
<p>Another possibility that might come to mind is to use finite differences (as in Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:finitedifference" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:finitedifference">4</a>), but you should not use this if you have lots of parameters! Finite differences would involve a calculation of something like <span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial g}{\partial p_k} \approx [g(p + \epsilon e_k) - g(p)]/\epsilon,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(e_k\)</span> is a unit vector in the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-th direction and <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> is a small number. This, however, requires one solve for each parameter <span class="math inline">\(p_k\)</span>, just like forward-mode differentiation. (It becomes even more expensive if you use fancier higher-order finite-difference approximations in order to obtain higher accuracy.)</p>
<section id="nonlinear-equations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="nonlinear-equations">Nonlinear equations</h3>
<p>You can also apply adjoint/reverse differentiation to nonlinear equations. For instance, consider the gradient of the scalar function <span class="math inline">\(g(p) = f(x(p))\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(x(p)\in \R^n\)</span> solves some system of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> equations <span class="math inline">\(h(p,x) = 0 \in \R^n\)</span>. By the chain rule, <span class="math display">\[h(p,x) = 0 \implies \frac{\partial h}{\partial p} dp + \frac{\partial  h}{\partial x} dx = 0 \implies dx = -\left(\frac{\partial  h}{\partial x}\right)^{-1}  \frac{\partial h}{\partial p}   dp \,.\]</span> (This is an instance of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_function_theorem">Implicit Function Theorem</a>: as long as <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial  h}{\partial x}\)</span> is nonsingular, we can locally define a function <span class="math inline">\(x(p)\)</span> from an implicit equation <span class="math inline">\(h=0\)</span>, here by linearization.) Hence, <span class="math display">\[dg = f'(x) dx = - \underbrace{ f'(x) \left(\frac{\partial  h}{\partial x}\right)^{-1} }_{v^T} \frac{\partial h}{\partial p} dp \, .\]</span> Associating left-to-right again leads to a single “adjoint” equation: <span class="math inline">\((\partial h/\partial x)^T v = f'(x)^T = \nabla_x f\)</span>. In other words, it again only takes two solves to get both <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\nabla g\)</span>—one nonlinear “forward” solve for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and one linear “adjoint” solve for <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>! Thereafter, all derivatives <span class="math inline">\(\partial g/\partial p_k\)</span> are cheap dot products. (Note that the linear “adjoint” solve involves the transposed Jacobian <span class="math inline">\(\partial h/\partial x\)</span>. Except for the transpose, this is very similar to the cost of a single Newton step to solve <span class="math inline">\(h=0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. So the adjoint problem should be cheaper than the forward problem.)</p>

<section id="adjoint-methods-and-ad" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adjoint-methods-and-ad">Adjoint methods and AD</h3>
<p>If you use automatic differentiation (AD) systems, why do you need to learn this stuff? Doesn’t the AD do everything for you? In practice, however, it is often helpful to understand adjoint methods even if you use automatic differentiation. Firstly, it helps you understand when to use forward- vs.&nbsp;reverse-mode automatic differentiation. Secondly, many physical models call large software packages written over the decades in various languages that <em>cannot be differentiated automatically</em> by AD. You can typically correct this by just supplying a “vector–Jacobian product” <span class="math inline">\(y^T dx\)</span> for this physics, or even just <em>part</em> of the physics, and then AD will differentiate the rest and apply the chain rule for you. Lastly, often models involve approximate calculations (e.g.&nbsp;for the iterative solution of linear or nonlinear equations, numerical integration, and so forth), but AD tools often don’t “know” this and spend extra effort trying to differentiate the error in your approximation; in such cases, manually written derivative rules can sometimes be much more efficient. (For example, suppose your model involves solving a nonlinear system <span class="math inline">\(h(x,p) = 0\)</span> by an iterative approach like Newton’s method. Naive AD will be very inefficient because it will attempt to differentiate through all your Newton steps. Assuming that you converge your Newton solver to enough accuracy that the error is negligible, it is much more efficient to perform differentiation via the implicit-function theorem as described above, leading to a single linear adjoint solve.)</p>

<p>This section of notes follows <a href="https://rawcdn.githack.com/mitmath/matrixcalc/b08435612045b17745707f03900e4e4187a6f489/notes/determinant_and_inverse.html">this</a> Julia notebook. This notebook is a little bit short, but is an important and useful calculation.</p>
<div class="theorem">
<p>Given <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is a square matrix, we have <span class="math display">\[\nabla (\det A) = \mathrm{cofactor}(A) = (\det A)A^{-T} := \operatorname{adj}(A^T) = \operatorname{adj}(A)^T\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{adj}\)</span> is the “adjugate”. (You may not have heard of the matrix adjugate, but this formula tells us that it is simply <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{adj}(A) = \det(A) A^{-1}\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{cofactor}(A) = \operatorname{adj}(A^T)\)</span>.) Furthermore, <span class="math display">\[d(\det A) = \tr(\det(A) A^{-1} dA) = \tr (\operatorname{adj}(A) dA) = \tr(\mathrm{cofactor}(A)^T dA).\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>You may remember that each entry <span class="math inline">\((i,j)\)</span> of the cofactor matrix is <span class="math inline">\((-1)^{i + j}\)</span> times the determinant obtained by deleting row <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and column <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Here are some <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 2\)</span> calculuations to obtain some intuition about these functions: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    M &amp;= \begin{pmatrix}
        a &amp; c \\ b &amp; d    
    \end{pmatrix} \\
    \implies \mathrm{cofactor}(M) &amp;= \begin{pmatrix}
         d &amp; -c \\ -b &amp; a
    \end{pmatrix}  \\
    \operatorname{adj}(M) &amp;= \begin{pmatrix}
d &amp; -b \\ -c &amp; a
\end{pmatrix} \\
(M)^{-1}  &amp;= \frac{1}{ad-bc} \begin{pmatrix}
    d &amp; -b \\ -c &amp; a
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Numerically, as is done in the notebook, you can construct a random <span class="math inline">\(n \times n\)</span> matrix <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> (say, <span class="math inline">\(9 \times 9\)</span>), consider e.g.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(dA = .00001 A\)</span>, and see numerically that <span class="math display">\[\det(A + dA) - \det (A) \approx \tr(\operatorname{adj}(A) dA),\]</span> which numerically supports our claim for the theorem.</p>
<p>We now prove the theorem in two ways. Firstly, there is a direct proof where you just differentiate the scalar with respect to every input using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_expansion">cofactor expansion</a> of the determinant based on the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th row. Recall that <span class="math display">\[\det (A) = A_{i1} C_{i1} +A_{i2} C_{i2} + \dots + A_{in} C_{in}.\]</span> Thus, <span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial \det A}{ \partial A_{ij}} = C_{ij} \implies \nabla (\det A) = C,\]</span> the cofactor matrix. (In computing these partial derivatives, it’s important to remember that the cofactor <span class="math inline">\(C_{ij}\)</span> contains no elements of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> from row&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> or column&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. So, for example, <span class="math inline">\(A_{i1}\)</span> only appears explicitly in the first term, and not hidden in any of the <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> terms in this expansion.)</p>
<p>There is also a fancier proof of the theorem using linearization near the identity. Firstly, note that it is easy to see from the properties of determinants that <span class="math display">\[\det(I + dA) - 1 = \tr(dA),\]</span> and thus <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \det(A + A(A^{-1} dA)) - \det (A) &amp;= \det(A) (\det (I + A^{-1} dA) - 1) \\
    &amp;= \det(A) \tr(A^{-1} dA) = \tr(\det (A) A^{-1} dA) \\
    &amp;= \tr(\operatorname{adj}(A) dA).
\end{aligned}\]</span> This also implies the theorem.</p>

<section id="characteristic-polynomial" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="characteristic-polynomial">Characteristic Polynomial</h3>
<p>We now use this as an application to find the derivative of a characteristic polynomial evaluated at <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = \det(xI -A)\)</span>, a scalar function of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Recall that through factorization, <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> may be written in terms of eigenvalues <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_i\)</span>. So we may ask: what is the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span>, the characteristic polynomial at <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>? Using freshman calculus, we could simply compute <span class="math display">\[\frac{d}{dx} \prod_i (x-\lambda_i) = \sum_i \prod_{j\neq i} (x-\lambda_j)  = \prod (x-\lambda_i) \{\sum_i (x- \lambda_i)^{-1}\},\]</span> as long as <span class="math inline">\(x \neq \lambda_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>This is a perfectly good simply proof, but with our new technology we have a new proof: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    d(\det (x I - A)) &amp;= \det(x I - A) \tr((xI - A)^{-1} d(x I - A)) \\
    &amp;= \det(xI - A) \tr(x I - A)^{-1} dx.
\end{aligned}\]</span> Note that here we used that <span class="math inline">\(d(x I - A) = dx \, I\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is constant and <span class="math inline">\(\tr (A dx) = \tr(A) dx\)</span> since <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> is a scalar.</p>
<p>We may again check this computationally as we do in the notebook.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-logarithmic-derivative" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-logarithmic-derivative">The Logarithmic Derivative</h3>
<p>We can similarly compute using the chain rule that <span class="math display">\[d(\log (\det (A))) = \frac{d(\det A)}{ \det A} = \det (A^{-1}) d(\det (A)) = \tr(A^{-1} dA).\]</span> The logarithmic derivative shows up a lot in applied mathematics. Note that here we use that <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\det A} = \det(A^{-1})\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(1 = \det(I) = \det(AA^{-1}) = \det (A) \det(A^{-1}).\)</span></p>
<p>For instance, recall Newton’s method to find roots <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=0\)</span> of single-variable real-valued functions <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> by taking a sequence of steps <span class="math inline">\(x \to x + \delta x\)</span>. The key formula in Newton’s method is <span class="math inline">\(\delta x = f'(x)^{-1}f(x)\)</span>, but this is the same as <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{(\log f(x))'}\)</span>. So, derivatives of log determinants show up in finding <em>roots of determinants</em>, i.e.&nbsp;for <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = \det M(x)\)</span>. When <span class="math inline">\(M(x) = A - x I\)</span>, roots of the determinant are eigenvalues of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. For more general functions <span class="math inline">\(M(x)\)</span>, solving <span class="math inline">\(\det M(x) = 0\)</span> is therefore called a <em>nonlinear eigenproblem</em>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec:jacobian-inverse">Jacobian of the Inverse</h2>
<p>Lastly, we compute the derivative (as both a linear operator and an explicit Jacobian matrix) of the inverse of a matrix. There is a neat trick to obtain this derivative, simply from the property <span class="math inline">\(A^{-1}A = I\)</span> of the inverse. By the product rule, this implies that <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
d(A^{-1} A) &amp;= d(I) = 0 = d(A^{-1}) A + A^{-1} dA \\
&amp; \implies \boxed{d(A^{-1}) = (A^{-1})'[dA] = - A^{-1} \, dA \, A^{-1} }\, .
\end{aligned}\]</span> Here, the second line defines a perfectly good linear operator for the derivative <span class="math inline">\((A^{-1})'\)</span>, but if we want we can rewrite this as an explicit Jacobian matrix by using Kronecker products acting on the “vectorized” matrices as we did in Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:kronecker" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:kronecker">3</a>: <span class="math display">\[\operatorname{vec}\left(d(A^{-1})\right) = \operatorname{vec}\left(-A^{-1} (dA) A^{-1}\right) = \underbrace{- (A^{-T} \otimes A^{-1})}_\mathrm{Jacobian} \operatorname{vec}(dA) \, ,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(A^{-T}\)</span> denotes <span class="math inline">\((A^{-1})^T = (A^T)^{-1}\)</span>. One can check this formula numerically, as is done in the notebook.</p>
<p>In practice, however, you will probably find that the operator expression <span class="math inline">\(- A^{-1} \, dA \, A^{-1}\)</span> is more useful than explicit Jacobian matrix for taking derivatives involving matrix inverses. For example, if you have a matrix-valued function <span class="math inline">\(A(t)\)</span> of a scalar parameter <span class="math inline">\(t \in \mathbb{R}\)</span>, you immediately obtain <span class="math inline">\(\frac{d(A^{-1})}{dt} = -A^{-1} \frac{dA}{dt} A^{-1}\)</span>. A more sophisticated application is discussed in Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:adjoint-method" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:adjoint-method">6.3</a>.</p>

<h1>Forward and Reverse-Mode Automatic Differentiation</h1>
<p>The first time that Professor Edelman had heard about automatic differentiation (AD), it was easy for him to imagine what it was …but what he imagined was wrong! In his head, he thought it was straightforward symbolic differentiation applied to code—sort of like executing Mathematica or Maple, or even just automatically doing what he learned to do in his calculus class. For instance, just plugging in functions and their domains from something like the following first-year calculus table:</p>
<div class="center">

<p>And in any case, if it wasn’t just like executing Mathematica or Maple, then it must be finite differences, like one learns in a numerical computing class (or as we did in Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:finitedifference" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:finitedifference">4</a>).</p>
<p>It turns out that it is definitely <em>not</em> finite differences—AD algorithms are generally exact (in exact arithmetic, neglecting roundoff errors), not approximate. But it also doesn’t look much like conventional symbolic algebra: the computer doesn’t really construct a big “unrolled” symbolic expression and then differentiate it, the way you might imagine doing by hand or via computer-algebra software. For example, imagine a computer program that computes <span class="math inline">\(\det A\)</span> for an <span class="math inline">\(n \times n\)</span> matrix—writing down the “whole” symbolic expression isn’t possible until the program runs and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is known (e.g.&nbsp;input by the user), and in any case a naive symbolic expression would require <span class="math inline">\(n!\)</span> terms. Thus, AD systems have to deal with computer-programming constructs like loops, recursion, and problem sizes <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> that are unknown until the program runs, while at the same time avoiding constructing symbolic expressions whose size becomes prohibitively large. (See Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:babylonian" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:babylonian">8.1.1</a> for an example that looks very different from the formulas you differentiate in first-year calculus.) Design of AD systems often ends up being more about compilers than about calculus!</p>
<section id="sec:dual-AD" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec:dual-AD">Automatic Differentiation via Dual Numbers</h2>
<p><em>(This lecture is accompanied by a Julia “notebook” showing the results of various computational experiments, which can be found on the course web page. Excerpts from those experiments are included below.)</em></p>
<p>One AD approach that can be explained relatively simply is “forward-mode” AD, which is implemented by carrying out the computation of <span class="math inline">\(f'\)</span> in <em>tandem</em> with the computation of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. One augments every intermediate value&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> in the computer program with another value&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> that represents its derivative, along with chain rules to propagate these derivatives through computations on values in the program. It turns out that this can be thought of as replacing real numbers (values&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>) with a new kind of “dual number” <span class="math inline">\(D(a,b)\)</span> (values &amp; derivatives) and corresponding arithmetic rules, as explained below.</p>
<section id="sec:babylonian" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec:babylonian">Example: Babylonian square root</h3>
<p>We start with a simple example, an algorithm for the square-root function, where a practical method of automatic differentiation came as both a mathematical surprise and a computing wonder for Professor Edelman. In particular, we consider the “Babylonian” algorithm to compute <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{x}\)</span>, known for millennia (and later revealed as a special case of Newton’s method applied to <span class="math inline">\(t^2 - x = 0\)</span>): simply repeat <span class="math inline">\(t \leftarrow (t + x/t)/2\)</span> until <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> converges to <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{x}\)</span> to any desired accuracy. Each iteration has one addition and two divisions. For illustration purposes, 10 iterations suffice. Here is a short program in Julia that implements this algorithm, starting with a guess of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and then performing <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> steps (defaulting to <span class="math inline">\(N=10\)</span>):</p>
<pre class="jlcon"><code>julia&gt; function Babylonian(x; N = 10) 
           t = (1+x)/2   # one step from t=1
           for i = 2:N   # remaining N-1 steps
               t = (t + x/t) / 2
           end    
           return t
       end</code></pre>
<p>If we run this function to compute the square root of <span class="math inline">\(x=4\)</span>, we will see that it converges very quickly: for only <span class="math inline">\(N=3\)</span> steps, it obtains the correct answer&nbsp;(<span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>) to nearly&nbsp;3 decimal places, and well before <span class="math inline">\(N=10\)</span> steps it has converged to <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> within the limits of the accuracy of computer arithmetic (about 16 digits). In fact, it roughly doubles the number of correct digits on every step:</p>
<pre class="jlcon"><code>julia&gt; Babylonian(4, N=1)

julia&gt; Babylonian(4, N=2)

<p>Of course, any first-year calculus student knows the derivative of the square root, <span class="math inline">\((\sqrt{x})' = 0.5/\sqrt{x}\)</span>, which we could compute here via <code>0.5 / Babylonian(x)</code>, but we want to know how we can obtain this derivative <em>automatically</em>, directly from the Babylonian algorithm itself. If we can figure out how to easily and efficiently pass the chain rule through this algorithm, then we will begin to understand how AD can also differentiate much more complicated computer programs for which no simple derivative formula is known.</p>
</section>
<section id="easy-forward-mode-ad" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="easy-forward-mode-ad">Easy forward-mode AD</h3>
<p>The basic idea of carrying the chain rule through a computer program is very simple: replace every number with <em>two</em> numbers, one which keeps track of the <em>value</em> and one which tracks the <em>derivative</em> of that value. The values are computed the same way as before, and the derivatives are computed by carrying out the chain rule for elementary operations like <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(/\)</span>.</p>
<p>In Julia, we can implement this idea by defining a new type of number, which we’ll call <code>D</code>, that encapsulates a value <code>val</code> and a derivative <code>deriv</code>.</p>
<pre class="jlcon"><code>julia&gt; struct D &lt;: Number
           val::Float64
           deriv::Float64
       end</code></pre>
<p>(A detailed explanation of Julia syntax can be found <a href="https://julialang.org/learning/">elsewhere</a>, but hopefully you can follow the basic ideas even if you don’t understand every punctuation mark.) A quantity <code>x = D(a,b)</code> of this new type has two components <code>x.val = a</code> and <code>x.deriv = b</code>, which we will use to represent values and derivatives, respectively. The <code>Babylonian</code> code only uses two arithmetic operations, <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(/\)</span>, so we just need to overload the built-in (“<code>Base</code>”) definitions of these in Julia to include new rules for our <code>D</code> type:</p>
<pre class="jlcon"><code>julia&gt; Base.:+(x::D, y::D) = D(x.val+y.val, x.deriv+y.deriv)
       Base.:/(x::D, y::D) = D(x.val/y.val, (y.val*x.deriv - x.val*y.deriv)/y.val^2)</code></pre>
<p>If you look closely, you’ll see that the values are just added and divided in the ordinary way, while the derivatives are computed using the sum rule (adding the derivatives of the inputs) and the quotient rule, respectively. We also need one other technical trick: we need to define <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/conversion-and-promotion/">“conversion” and “promotion” rules</a> that tell Julia how to combine <code>D</code> values with ordinary real numbers, as in expressions like <span class="math inline">\(x+1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(x/2\)</span>:</p>
<pre class="jlcon"><code>julia&gt; Base.convert(::Type{D}, r::Real) = D(r,0)
       Base.promote_rule(::Type{D}, ::Type{&lt;:Real}) = D</code></pre>
<p>This just says that an ordinary real number <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is combined with a <code>D</code> value by first converting <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> to <code>D(r,0)</code>: the value is&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and the derivative is <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> (the derivative of any constant is zero).</p>
<p>Given these definitions, we can now plug a <code>D</code> value into our <em>unmodified</em> <code>Babylonian</code> function, and it will “magically” compute the derivative of the square root. Let’s try it for <span class="math inline">\(x = 49 = 7^2\)</span>:</p>
<pre class="jlcon"><code>julia&gt; x = 49
49

julia&gt; Babylonian(D(x,1))
D(7.0, 0.07142857142857142)</code></pre>
<p>We can see that it correctly returned a value of <code>7.0</code> and a derivative of <code>0.07142857142857142</code>, which indeed matches the square root <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{49}\)</span> and its derivative <span class="math inline">\(0.5/\sqrt{49}\)</span>:</p>
<pre class="jlcon"><code>julia&gt; (√x, 0.5/√x)
(7.0, 0.07142857142857142)</code></pre>
<p>Why did we input <code>D(x,1)</code>? Where did the <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> come from? That’s simply the fact that the derivative of the input <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> with respect to <em>itself</em> is <span class="math inline">\((x)' = 1\)</span>, so this is the starting point for the chain rule.</p>
<p>In practice, all this (and more) has already been implemented in the <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ForwardDiff.jl">ForwardDiff.jl</a> package in Julia (and in many similar software packages in a variety of languages). That package hides the implementation details under the hood and explicitly provides a function to compute the derivative. For example:</p>
<pre class="jlcon"><code>julia&gt; using ForwardDiff

julia&gt; ForwardDiff.derivative(Babylonian, 49)
0.07142857142857142</code></pre>
<p>Essentially, however, this is the same as our little <code>D</code> implementation, but implemented with greater generality and sophistication (e.g.&nbsp;chain rules for more operations, support for more numeric types, partial derivatives with respect to multiple variables, etc.): just as we did, ForwardDiff augments every value with a second number that tracks the derivative, and propagates both quantities through the calculation.</p>
<p>We could have also implemented the same idea specifically for the Bablylonian algorithm, by writing a new function <code>dBabylonian</code> that tracks both the variable <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and its derivative <span class="math inline">\(t' = dt/dx\)</span> through the course of the calculation:</p>
<pre class="jlcon"><code>julia&gt; function dBabylonian(x; N = 10) 
           t = (1+x)/2
           t′ = 1/2
           for i = 1:N
               t = (t+x/t)/2
               t′= (t′+(t-x*t′)/t^2)/2
           end    
           return t′
       end

julia&gt; dBabylonian(49)
0.07142857142857142</code></pre>
<p>This is doing <em>exactly</em> the same calculations as calling <code>Babylonian(D(x,1))</code> or <code>ForwardDiff.derivative(Babylonian, 49)</code>, but needs a lot more human effort—we’d have to do this for every computer program we write, rather than implementing a new number type <em>once</em>.</p>
</section>
<section id="dual-numbers" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dual-numbers">Dual numbers</h3>
<p>There is a pleasing algebraic way to think about our new number type <span class="math inline">\(D(a,b)\)</span> instead of the “value &amp; derivative” viewpoint above. Remember how a complex number <span class="math inline">\(a + bi\)</span> is formed from two real numbers <span class="math inline">\((a,b)\)</span> by defining a special new quantity <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> (the imaginary unit) that satisfies <span class="math inline">\(i^2 = -1\)</span>, and all the other complex-arithmetic rules follow from this? Similarly, we can think of <span class="math inline">\(D(a,b)\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(a + b \epsilon\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> is a new “infinitesimal unit” quantity that satisfies <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon^2 = 0\)</span>. This viewpoint is called a <strong>dual number</strong>.</p>
<p>Given the elementary rule <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon^2 = 0\)</span>, the other algebraic rules for dual numbers immediately follow: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    (a + b \epsilon) \pm (c + d \epsilon) &amp;= (a \pm c) + (b \pm d) \epsilon \\
    (a + b \epsilon) \cdot (c + d\epsilon) &amp;= (ac) + (bc + ad) \epsilon \\
    \frac{a + b \epsilon}{c + d \epsilon} &amp;= \frac{a + b \epsilon}{c + d \epsilon} \cdot \frac{c - d \epsilon}{c - d \epsilon} = \frac{(a + b \epsilon)(c - d \epsilon)}{c^2}  =     
    \frac{a}{c} + \frac{bc - ad}{c^2}\epsilon.
\end{aligned}\]</span> The <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> coefficients of these rules correspond to the sum/difference, product, and quotient rules of differential calculus!</p>
<p>In fact, these are <em>exactly</em> the rules we implemented above for our <code>D</code> type. We were only missing the rules for subtraction and multiplication, which we can now include:</p>
<pre class="jlcon"><code>julia&gt; Base.:-(x::D, y::D) = D(x.val - y.val, x.deriv - y.deriv)
       Base.:*(x::D, y::D) = D(x.val*y.val, x.deriv*y.val + x.val*y.deriv)</code></pre>
<p>It’s also nice to add a <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/types/#man-custom-pretty-printing">“pretty printing”</a> rule to make Julia display dual numbers as <code>a + bϵ</code> rather than as <code>D(a,b)</code>:</p>
<pre class="jlcon"><code>julia&gt; Base.show(io::IO, x::D) = print(io, x.val, " + ", x.deriv, "ϵ")</code></pre>
<p>Once we implement the multiplication rule for dual numbers in Julia, then <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon^2 = 0\)</span> follows from the special case <span class="math inline">\(a = c=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b=d=1\)</span>:</p>
<pre class="jlcon"><code>julia&gt; ϵ = D(0,1)
0.0 + 1.0ϵ

julia&gt; ϵ * ϵ 
0.0 + 0.0ϵ

julia&gt; ϵ^2
0.0 + 0.0ϵ</code></pre>
<p>(We didn’t define a rule for powers <span class="math inline">\(D(a,b)^n\)</span>, so how did it compute <code>ϵ</code><span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>? The answer is that Julia implements <span class="math inline">\(x^n\)</span> via repeated multiplication by default, so it sufficed to define the <span class="math inline">\(*\)</span> rule.) Now, we can compute the derivative of the Babylonian algorithm at <span class="math inline">\(x = 49\)</span> as above by:</p>
<pre class="jlcon"><code>julia&gt; Babylonian(x + ϵ)
7.0 + 0.07142857142857142ϵ</code></pre>
<p>with the “infinitesimal part” being the derivative <span class="math inline">\(0.5/\sqrt{49} = 0.0714\cdots\)</span>.</p>
<p>A nice thing about this dual-number viewpoint is that it corresponds directly to our notion of a derivative as linearization: <span class="math display">\[f(x + \epsilon) = f(x) + f'(x) \epsilon + \mbox{(higher-order terms)} \, ,\]</span> with the dual-number rule <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon^2 = 0\)</span> corresponding to dropping the higher-order terms.</p>

<p>Forward-mode AD implements the exact analytical derivative by propagating chain rules, but it is completely different from what many people <em>imagine</em> AD might be: evaluating a program <em>symbolically</em> to obtain a giant symbolic expression, and <em>then</em> differentiating this giant expression to obtain the derivative. A basic issue with this approach is that the size of these symbolic expressions can quickly explode as the program runs. Let’s see what it would look like for the Babylonian algorithm.</p>
<p>Imagine inputting a “symbolic variable” <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> into our <code>Babylonian</code> code, running the algorithm, and writing a big algebraic expression for the result. After only one step, for example, we would get <span class="math inline">\((x + 1)/2\)</span>. After two steps, we would get <span class="math inline">\(((x+1)/2 + 2x/(x+1))/2\)</span>, which simplifies to a ratio of two polynomials (a “rational function”): <span class="math display">\[\frac{x^2 + 6x + 1}{4(x+1)} \, .\]</span> Continuing this process by hand is quite tedious, but fortunately the computer can do it for us (as shown in the accompanying Julia notebook). Three Babylonian iterations yields: <span class="math display">\[\frac{x^{4} + 28 x^{3} + 70 x^{2} + 28 x + 1}{8 \left(x^{3} + 7 x^{2} + 7 x + 1\right)} \, ,\]</span> four iterations gives <span class="math display">\[\frac{x^{8} + 120 x^{7} + 1820 x^{6} + 8008 x^{5} + 12870 x^{4} + 8008 x^{3} + 1820 x^{2} + 120 x + 1}{16 \left(x^{7} + 35 x^{6} + 273 x^{5} + 715 x^{4} + 715 x^{3} + 273 x^{2} + 35 x + 1\right)} \, ,\]</span> and five iterations produces the enormous expression: <span class="math display">\[\resizebox{1.0\hsize}{!}{$\frac{x^{16} + 496 x^{15} + 35960 x^{14} + 906192 x^{13} + 10518300 x^{12} + 64512240 x^{11} + 225792840 x^{10} + 471435600 x^{9} + 601080390 x^{8} + 471435600 x^{7} + 225792840 x^{6} + 64512240 x^{5} + 10518300 x^{4} + 906192 x^{3} + 35960 x^{2} + 496 x + 1}{32 \left(x^{15} + 155 x^{14} + 6293 x^{13} + 105183 x^{12} + 876525 x^{11} + 4032015 x^{10} + 10855425 x^{9} + 17678835 x^{8} + 17678835 x^{7} + 10855425 x^{6} + 4032015 x^{5} + 876525 x^{4} + 105183 x^{3} + 6293 x^{2} + 155 x + 1\right)}$} \, .\]</span> Notice how quickly these grow—in fact, the degree of the polynomials doubles on every iteration! Now, if we take the symbolic derivatives of these functions using our ordinary calculus rules, and simplify (with the help of the computer), the derivative of one iteration is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span>, of two iterations is <span class="math display">\[\frac{x^{2} + 2 x + 5}{4 \left(x^{2} + 2 x + 1\right)} \, ,\]</span> of three iterations is <span class="math display">\[\frac{x^{6} + 14 x^{5} + 147 x^{4} + 340 x^{3} + 375 x^{2} + 126 x + 21}{8 \left(x^{6} + 14 x^{5} + 63 x^{4} + 100 x^{3} + 63 x^{2} + 14 x + 1\right)} \, ,\]</span> of four iterations is <span class="math display">\[\resizebox{1.0\hsize}{!}{$\frac{x^{14} + 70 x^{13} + 3199 x^{12} + 52364 x^{11} + 438945 x^{10} + 2014506 x^{9} + 5430215 x^{8} + 8836200 x^{7} + 8842635 x^{6} + 5425210 x^{5} + 2017509 x^{4} + 437580 x^{3} + 52819 x^{2} + 3094 x + 85}{16 \left(x^{14} + 70 x^{13} + 1771 x^{12} + 20540 x^{11} + 126009 x^{10} + 440986 x^{9} + 920795 x^{8} + 1173960 x^{7} + 920795 x^{6} + 440986 x^{5} + 126009 x^{4} + 20540 x^{3} + 1771 x^{2} + 70 x + 1\right)}$} \, ,\]</span> and of five iterations is a monstrosity you can only read by zooming in: <span class="math display">\[\resizebox{1.0\hsize}{!}{$\frac{x^{30} + 310 x^{29} + 59799 x^{28} + 4851004 x^{27} + 215176549 x^{26} + 5809257090 x^{25} + 102632077611 x^{24} + 1246240871640 x^{23} + 10776333438765 x^{22} + 68124037776390 x^{21} + 321156247784955 x^{20} + 1146261110726340 x^{19} + 3133113888931089 x^{18} + 6614351291211874 x^{17} + 10850143060249839 x^{16} + 13883516068991952 x^{15} + 13883516369532147 x^{14} + 10850142795067314 x^{13} + 6614351497464949 x^{12} + 3133113747810564 x^{11} + 1146261195398655 x^{10} + 321156203432790 x^{9} + 68124057936465 x^{8} + 10776325550040 x^{7} + 1246243501215 x^{6} + 102631341330 x^{5} + 5809427001 x^{4} + 215145084 x^{3} + 4855499 x^{2} + 59334 x + 341}{32 \left(x^{30} + 310 x^{29} + 36611 x^{28} + 2161196 x^{27} + 73961629 x^{26} + 1603620018 x^{25} + 23367042639 x^{24} + 238538538360 x^{23} + 1758637118685 x^{22} + 9579944198310 x^{21} + 39232152623175 x^{20} + 122387258419860 x^{19} + 293729420641881 x^{18} + 546274556891506 x^{17} + 791156255418003 x^{16} + 894836006026128 x^{15} + 791156255418003 x^{14} + 546274556891506 x^{13} + 293729420641881 x^{12} + 122387258419860 x^{11} + 39232152623175 x^{10} + 9579944198310 x^{9} + 1758637118685 x^{8} + 238538538360 x^{7} + 23367042639 x^{6} + 1603620018 x^{5} + 73961629 x^{4} + 2161196 x^{3} + 36611 x^{2} + 310 x + 1\right)}$} \, .\]</span> This is a terrible way to compute derivatives!

<p>To be clear, the dual number approach (absent rounding errors) computes an answer exactly as if it evaluated these crazy expressions at some particular <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, but the words “as if” are very important here. As you can see, we do not form these expressions, let alone evaluate them. We merely compute results that are equal to the values we would have gotten if we had.</p>

<section id="automatic-differentiation-via-computational-graphs" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="automatic-differentiation-via-computational-graphs">Automatic Differentiation via Computational Graphs</h2>
<p>Let’s now get into automatic differentiation via computational graphs. For this section, we consider the following simple motivating example.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="ex:compute-graph" data-label="ex:compute-graph"></span> Define the following functions: <span class="math display">\[\begin{cases}
        a(x,y) = \sin x \\
        b(x,y) = \frac{1}{y}\cdot a(x,y) \\
        z(x,y) = b(x,y) + x.
    \end{cases}\]</span> Compute <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial z}{\partial y}.\)</span></p>
</div>
<p>There are a few ways to solve this problem. Firstly, of course, one can compute this symbolically, noting that <span class="math display">\[z(x,y) = b(x,y) + x = \frac{1}{y} a(x,y) + x = \frac{\sin x}{y} + x,\]</span> which implies <span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = \frac{\cos x}{y} + 1 \hspace{.25cm} \text{and} \hspace{.25cm} \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} = -\frac{\sin x}{y^2}.\]</span></p>
<p>However, one can also use a Computational Graph (see Figure of Computational Graph below) where the edge from node <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to node <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is labelled with <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial B}{\partial A}\)</span>.</p>

The nodes are labelled by <em>values</em>, and edges are labelled with the <em>derivatives</em> of the values with respect to the preceding values.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now how do we use this directed acyclic graph (DAG) to find the derivatives? Well one view (called the “forward view”) is given by following the paths from the inputs to the outputs and (left) multiplying as you go, adding together multiple paths. For instance, following this procedure for paths from <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(z(x,y)\)</span>, we have <span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{y} \cdot \cos x + 1 = \frac{\cos x}{y} + 1.\]</span> Similarly, for paths from <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(z(x,y)\)</span>, we have <span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial z}{\partial y} = 1 \cdot \frac{-a(x,y)}{ y^2} = \frac{- \sin x}{y^2},\]</span> and if you have numerical derivatives on the edges, this algorithm works. Alternatively, you could follow a reverse view and follow the paths backwards (multiplying right to left), and obtain the same result. Note that there is nothing magic about these being scalar here– you could imagine these functions are the type that we are seeing in this class and do the same computations! The only thing that matters here fundamentally is the associativity. However, when considering vector-valued functions, the order in which you multiply the edge weights is vitally important (as vector/matrix valued functions are not generally commutative).</p>
<p>The graph-theoretic way of thinking about this is to consider “path products”. A path product is the product of edge weights as you traverse a path. In this way, we are interested in the sum of path products from inputs to outputs to compute derivatives using computational graphs. Clearly, we don’t particularly care which order we traverse the paths as long as the <em>order</em> we take the product in is correct. In this way, forward and reverse-mode automatic differentiation is not so mysterious.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer view of the implementation of forward-mode automatic differentiation. Suppose we are at a node <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> during the process of computing the derivative of a computational graph, as shown in the figure below:</p>
<figure class="figure">
<div class="center">

</div>
</figure>
<p>Suppose we know the path product <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> of all the edges up to and including the one from <span class="math inline">\(B_2\)</span>? to <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Then what is the new path product as we move to the right from <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>? It is <span class="math inline">\(f'(A)\cdot P\)</span>! So we need a data structure that maps in the following way: <span class="math display">\[(\text{value}, \text{path product}) \mapsto (f(\text{value}), f'\cdot \text{path product}).\]</span> In some sense, this is another way to look at the Dual Numbers– taking in our path products and spitting out values. In any case, we overload our program which can easily calculate <span class="math inline">\(f(\text{value})\)</span> and tack-on <span class="math inline">\(f'\cdot \text{(path product)}\)</span>.</p>
<p>One might ask how our program starts– this is how the program works in the “middle”, but what should our starting value be? Well the only thing it can be for this method to work is <span class="math inline">\((x, 1)\)</span>. Then, at every step you do the following map listed above: <span class="math display">\[(\text{value}, \text{path product}) \mapsto (f(\text{value}), f'\cdot \text{path product}),\]</span> and at the end we obtain our derivatives.</p>
<p>Now how do we combine arrows? In other words, suppose at the two notes on the LHS we have the values <span class="math inline">\((a,p)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((b,q)\)</span>, as seen in the diagram below:</p>
<figure class="figure">
<div class="center">

</div>
</figure>
<p>So here, we aren’t thinking of <span class="math inline">\(a,b\)</span> as numbers, but as variables. What should the new output value be? We want to add the two path products together, obtaining <span class="math display">\[\left(f(a,b), \frac{\partial z}{\partial a} p + \frac{\partial z}{\partial b} q\right).\]</span> So really, our overloaded data structure looks like this:</p>
<figure class="figure">
<div class="center">

</div>
</figure>
<p>This diagram of course generalizes if we may many different nodes on the left side of the graph.</p>
<p>If we come up with such a data structure for all of the simple computations (addition/subtraction, multiplication, and division), and if this is all we need for our computer program, then we are set! Here is how we define the structure for addition/subtraction, multiplication, and division.</p>
<p><strong>Addition/Subtraction:</strong> See figure.</p>

<p>In theory, these three graphs are all we need, and we can use Taylor series expansions for more complicated functions. But in practice, we throw in what the derivatives of more complicated functions are so that we don’t waste our time trying to compute something we already know, like the derivative of sine or of a logarithm.</p>
<section id="reverse-mode-automatic-differentiation-on-graphs" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reverse-mode-automatic-differentiation-on-graphs">Reverse Mode Automatic Differentiation on Graphs</h3>
<p>When we do reverse mode, we have arrows going the other direction, which we will understand in this section of the notes. In forward mode it was all about “what do we depend on,” i.e.&nbsp;computing the derivative on the right hand side of the above diagram using the functions in the nodes on the left. In reverse mode, the question is really “what are we influenced by?” or “what do we influence later?”</p>
<p>When going “backwards,” we need know what nodes a given node influences. For instance, given a node A, we want to know the nodes <span class="math inline">\(B_i\)</span> that is influenced by, or depends on, node <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. So now our diagram looks like this:</p>
<figure class="figure">
<div class="center">

</div>
</figure>
<p>So now, we eventually have a final node <span class="math inline">\((z,1)\)</span> (far on the right hand side) where everything starts. This time, all of our multiplications take place from right to left as we are in reverse mode. Our goal is to be able to calculate the node <span class="math inline">\((x,\partial z/\partial x)\)</span>. So if we know how to fill in the <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial z}{\partial a}\)</span> term, we will be able to go from right to left in these computational graphs (i.e., in reverse mode). In fact, the formula for getting <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial z}{\partial a}\)</span> is given by <span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial z}{\partial a} = \sum_{i=1}^s \frac{\partial b_i}{\partial a} \frac{\partial z}{\partial b_i}\]</span> where the <span class="math inline">\(b_i\)</span>s come from the nodes that are influenced by the node <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. This is again just another chain rule like from calculus, but you can also view this as multiplying the sums of all the weights in the graph influenced by <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<figure class="figure">
<div class="center">

</div>
</figure>
<p>Why can reverse mode be more efficient than forward mode? One reason it because it can save data and use it later. Take, for instance, the following sink/source computational graph.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(x,y\)</span> here are our sources, and <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is our sink, we want to compute the sum of products of weights on paths from sources to sinks. If we were using forward mode, we would need to compute the paths <span class="math inline">\(dca\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(dcb\)</span>, which requires four multiplications (and then you would add them together). If we were using reverse mode, we would only need compute <span class="math inline">\(a\underline{cd}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\underline{cd}\)</span> and sum them; notice reverse mode (since we need only compute <span class="math inline">\(cd\)</span> once), only takes 3 multiplications. In general, this can more efficiently resolve certain types of problems, such as the source/sink one.</p>

<section id="sec:forward-vs-reverse" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec:forward-vs-reverse">Forward- vs.&nbsp;Reverse-mode Differentiation</h2>
<p>In this section, we briefly summarize the relative benefits and drawbacks of these two approaches to computation of derivatives (whether worked out by hand or using AD software). From a mathematical point of view, the two approaches are mirror images, but from a computational point of view they are quite different, because computer programs normally proceed “forwards” in time from inputs to outputs.</p>
<p>Suppose we are differentiating a function <span class="math inline">\(f: \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto \mathbb{R}^m\)</span>, mapping <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> scalar inputs (an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-dimensional input) to <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> scalar outputs (an <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>-dimensional output). The first key distinction of forward- vs.&nbsp;reverse-mode is how the computational cost scales with the number/dimension of inputs and outputs:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The cost of forward-mode differentiation (inputs-to-outputs) scales proportional to&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, the number of <em>inputs</em>. This is ideal for functions where <span class="math inline">\(n \ll m\)</span> (few inputs, many outputs).</p></li>
<li><p>The cost of reverse-mode differentiation (outputs-to-inputs) scales proportional to&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, the number of <em>outputs</em>. This is ideal for functions where <span class="math inline">\(m \ll n\)</span> (few outputs, many inputs).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Before this chapter, we first saw these scalings in Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:cost-matrix-mult" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:cost-matrix-mult">2.5.1</a>, and again in Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:adjoint-method" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:adjoint-method">6.3</a>; in a future lecture, we’ll see it yet again in Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:ODE-sensitivity" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:ODE-sensitivity">9.2</a>. The case of few outputs is extremely common in large-scale optimization (whether for machine learning, engineering design, or other applications), because then one has many optimization parameters (<span class="math inline">\(n\gg 1\)</span>) but only a single output (<span class="math inline">\(m=1\)</span>) corresponding to the objective (or “loss”) function, or sometimes a few outputs corresponding to objective and constraint functions. Hence, reverse-mode differentiation (“backpropagation”) is the dominant approach for large-scale optimization and applications such as training neural networks.</p>
<p>There are other practical issues worth considering, however:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Forward-mode differentiation proceeds in the same order as the computation of the function itself, from inputs to outputs. This seems to make forward-mode AD easier to implement (e.g.&nbsp;our sample implementation in Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:dual-AD" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:dual-AD">8.1</a>) and efficient.</p></li>
<li><p>Reverse-mode differentiation proceeds in the <em>opposite</em> direction to ordinary computation. This makes reverse-mode AD much more complicated to implement, and adds a lot of <em>storage overhead</em> to the function computation. First you evaluate the function from inputs to outputs, but you (or the AD system) keep a <em>record</em> (a “tape”) of all the <em>intermediate steps</em> of the computation; then, you run the computation in <em>reverse</em> (“play the tape backwards”) to backpropagate the derivatives.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of these practical advantages, even for the case of many (<span class="math inline">\(n &gt;1\)</span>) inputs and a single (<span class="math inline">\(m = 1\)</span>) output, practitioners tell us that they’ve found forward mode to be more efficient until <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> becomes sufficiently large (perhaps even until&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(n &gt; 100\)</span>, depending on the function being differentiated and the AD implementation).

<p>If <span class="math inline">\(n = m\)</span>, where neither approach has a scaling advantage, one typically prefers the lower overhead and simplicity of forward-mode differentiation. This case arises in computing explicit Jacobian matrices for nonlinear root-finding (Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:newton-roots" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:newton-roots">6.1</a>), or Hessian matrices of second derivatives (Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:hessians" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:hessians">12</a>), for which one often uses forward mode…or even a <em>combination</em> of forward and reverse modes, as discussed below.</p>
<p>Of course, forward and reverse are not the only options. The chain rule is associative, so there are many possible orderings (e.g.&nbsp;starting from both ends and meeting in the middle, or vice versa). A difficult<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> problem that may often require hybrid schemes is to compute Jacobians (or Hessians) in a minimal number of operations, exploiting any problem-specific structure (e.g.&nbsp;sparsity: many entries may be zero). Discussion of this and other AD topics can be found, in vastly greater detail than in these notes, in the book <em>Evaluating Derivatives</em> (2nd ed.) by Griewank and Walther&nbsp;(2008).</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec:forward-over-reverse">Forward-over-reverse mode: Second derivatives</h3>
<p>Often, a <em>combination</em> of forward- and reverse-mode differentiation is advantageous when computing <em>second</em> derivatives, which arise in many practical applications.</p>
<p><strong>Hessian computation:</strong> For example, let us consider a function <span class="math inline">\(f(x): \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}\)</span> mapping <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> inputs <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to a single scalar. The first derivative <span class="math inline">\(f'(x) = (\nabla f)^T\)</span> is best computed by reverse mode if <span class="math inline">\(n \gg 1\)</span> (many inputs). Now, however, consider the <em>second</em> derivative, which is the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(g(x) = \nabla f\)</span>, mapping <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> inputs <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> outputs <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span>. It should be clear that <span class="math inline">\(g'(x)\)</span> is therefore an <span class="math inline">\(n \times n\)</span> Jacobian matrix, called the <strong>Hessian</strong> of&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, which we will discuss much more generally in Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:hessians" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:hessians">12</a>. Since <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span> has the same number of inputs and outputs, neither forward nor reverse mode has an inherent scaling advantage, so typically forward mode is chosen for <span class="math inline">\(g'\)</span> thanks to its practical simplicity, while still computing <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span> in reverse-mode. That is, we compute <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span> by reverse mode, but then compute <span class="math inline">\(g' = (\nabla f)'\)</span> by applying forward-mode differentiation to the <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span> algorithm. This is called a <strong>forward-over-reverse</strong> algorithm.</p>
<p>An even more clear-cut application of forward-over-reverse differentiation is to <strong>Hessian–vector products</strong>. In many applications, it turns out that what is required is only the <em>product</em> <span class="math inline">\((\nabla f)' v\)</span> of the Hessian <span class="math inline">\((\nabla f)'\)</span> with an arbitrary vector&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>. In this case, one can completely avoid computing (or storing) the Hessian matrix explicitly, and incur computational cost proportional only to that of a single function evaluation <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>. The trick is to recall (from Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:directional" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:directional">2.2.1</a>) that, for <em>any</em> function <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, the linear operation <span class="math inline">\(g'(x)[v]\)</span> is a <em>directional derivative</em>, equivalent to a <em>single-variable</em> derivative <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial}{\partial\alpha} g(x+\alpha v)\)</span> evaluated at <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 0\)</span>. Here, we simply apply that rule to the function <span class="math inline">\(g(x) = \nabla f\)</span>, and obtain the following formula for a Hessian–vector product: <span class="math display">\[(\nabla f)' v = \left. \frac{\partial}{\partial\alpha} \left( \left. \nabla f \right|_{x + \alpha v} \right) \right|_{\alpha=0} \, .\]</span> Computationally, the inner evaluation of the gradient <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span> at an arbitrary point <span class="math inline">\(x + \alpha v\)</span> can be accomplished efficiently by a reverse/adjoint/backpropagation algorithm. In contrast, the <em>outer</em> derivative with respect to a <em>single</em> input <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is best performed by forward-mode differentiation.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Since the Hessian matrix is symmetric (as discussed in great generality by Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:hessians" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:hessians">12</a>), the same algorithm works for <strong>vector–Hessian products</strong> <span class="math inline">\(v^T (\nabla f)' = [(\nabla f)' v]^T\)</span>, a fact that we employ in the next example.</p>
<p><strong>Scalar-valued functions of gradients:</strong> There is another common circumstance in which one often combines forward and reverse differentiation, but which can appear somewhat more subtle, and that is in differentiating a scalar-valued function of a gradient of another scalar-valued function. Consider the following example:</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(f(x): \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto \mathbb{R}\)</span> be a scalar-valued function of <span class="math inline">\(n \gg 1\)</span> inputs with gradient <span class="math inline">\(\left. \nabla f \right|_{x} = f'(x)^T\)</span>, and let <span class="math inline">\(g(z): \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto \mathbb{R}\)</span> be another such function with gradient <span class="math inline">\(\left. \nabla g \right|_{z} = g'(z)^T\)</span>. Now, consider the scalar-valued function <span class="math inline">\(h(x) = g(\left. \nabla f \right|_{x}): \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto \mathbb{R}\)</span> and compute <span class="math inline">\(\left. \nabla h \right|_{x} = h'(x)^T\)</span>.</p>
<p>Denote <span class="math inline">\(z = \left. \nabla f \right|_{x}\)</span>. By the chain rule, <span class="math inline">\(h'(x) = g'(z)(\nabla f)'(x)\)</span>, but we want to avoid explicitly computing the large <span class="math inline">\(n \times n\)</span> Hessian matrix <span class="math inline">\((\nabla f)'\)</span>. Instead, as discussed above, we use the fact that such a vector–Hessian product is equivalent (by symmetry of the Hessian) to the transpose of a Hessian–vector product multiplying the Hessian <span class="math inline">\((\nabla f)'\)</span> with the vector <span class="math inline">\(\nabla g = g'(z)^T\)</span>, which is equivalent to a directional derivative: <span class="math display">\[\left. \nabla h \right|_{x} = h'(x)^T =
\left. \frac{\partial}{\partial\alpha} \left( \left. \nabla f \right|_{x + \alpha \left. \nabla g \right|_{z}}\right) \right|_{\alpha = 0} \, ,\]</span> involving differentiation with respect to a single scalar <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in \mathbb{R}\)</span>. As for any Hessian–vector product, therefore, we can evaluate <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\nabla h\)</span> by:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Evaluate <span class="math inline">\(h(x)\)</span>: evaluate <span class="math inline">\(z = \left. \nabla f \right|_{x}\)</span> by reverse mode, and plug it into <span class="math inline">\(g(z)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate <span class="math inline">\(\nabla h\)</span>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Evaluate <span class="math inline">\(\left. \nabla g \right|_{z}\)</span> by reverse mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement <span class="math inline">\(\left. \nabla f \right|_{x + \alpha \left. \nabla g \right|_{z} }\)</span> by reverse mode, and then differentiate with respect to <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> by <em>forward</em> mode, evaluated at <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 0\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>This is a “forward-over-reverse” algorithm, where forward mode is used efficiently for the single-input derivative with respect to <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in \mathbb{R}\)</span>, combined with reverse mode to differentate with respect to <span class="math inline">\(x,z \in \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Example Julia code implementing the above “forward-over-reverse” process for just such a <span class="math inline">\(h(x)=g(\nabla f)\)</span> function is given below. Here, the forward-mode differentiation with respect to <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is implemented by the ForwardDiff.jl package discussed in Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:dual-AD" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:dual-AD">8.1</a>, while the reverse-mode differentiation with respect to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is performed by the <a href="https://fluxml.ai/Zygote.jl/stable/">Zygote.jl</a> package. First, let’s import the packages and define simple example functions <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = 1/\Vert x \Vert\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g(z) = (\sum_k z_k)^3\)</span>, along with the computation of <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> via Zygote:</p>
<pre class="jlcon"><code>julia&gt; using ForwardDiff, Zygote, LinearAlgebra
julia&gt; f(x) = 1/norm(x)
julia&gt; g(z) = sum(z)^3
julia&gt; h(x) = g(Zygote.gradient(f, x)[1])</code></pre>
<p>Now, we’ll compute <span class="math inline">\(\nabla h\)</span> by forward-over-reverse:</p>
<pre class="jlcon"><code>julia&gt; function ∇h(x)
           ∇f(y) = Zygote.gradient(f, y)[1]
           ∇g = Zygote.gradient(g, ∇f(x))[1]
           return ForwardDiff.derivative(α -&gt; ∇f(x + α*∇g), 0)
       end</code></pre>
<p>We can now plug in some random numbers and compare to a finite-difference check:</p>
<pre class="jlcon"><code>julia&gt; x = randn(5); δx = randn(5) * 1e-8;

julia&gt; h(x)
-0.005284687528953334

julia&gt; ∇h(x)
5-element Vector{Float64}:
 -0.006779692698531759

 -0.0012162087082746558
  0.007663756720005014

julia&gt; ∇h(x)' * δx    # directional derivative
-3.0273434457397667e-10

julia&gt; h(x+δx) - h(x)  # finite-difference check
-3.0273433933303284e-10</code></pre>
<p>The finite-difference check matches to about 7&nbsp;significant digits, which is as much as we can hope for—the forward-over-reverse code works!</p>
<div class="problem">
<p>A common variation on the above procedure, which often appears in machine learning, involves a function <span class="math inline">\(f(x,p) \in \mathbb{R}\)</span> that maps input “data” <span class="math inline">\(x \in \mathbb{R}^n\)</span> and “parameters” <span class="math inline">\(p \in \mathbb{R}^N\)</span> to a scalar. Let <span class="math inline">\(\nabla_x f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\nabla_p f\)</span> denote the gradients with respect to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, suppose we have a function <span class="math inline">\(g(z): \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto \mathbb{R}\)</span> as before, and define <span class="math inline">\(h(x,p) = g(\left. \nabla_x f \right|_{x,p})\)</span>. We want to compute <span class="math inline">\(\nabla_p h = (\partial h / \partial p)^T\)</span>, which will involve “mixed” derivatives of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> with respect to <em>both</em> <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>Show that you can compute <span class="math inline">\(\nabla_p h\)</span> by: <span class="math display">\[\left. \nabla_p h \right|_{x,p} =
\left. \frac{\partial}{\partial\alpha} \left( \left. \nabla_p f \right|_{x + \alpha \left. \nabla g \right|_{z},p}\right) \right|_{\alpha = 0} \, ,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(z = \left. \nabla_x f \right|_{x,p}\)</span>. (Crucially, this avoids ever computing an <span class="math inline">\(n \times N\)</span> mixed-derivative matrix of&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>.)</p>
<p>Try coming up with simple example functions <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, implementing the above formula by forward-over-reverse in Julia similar to above (forward mode for <span class="math inline">\(\partial/\partial \alpha\)</span> and reverse mode for the <span class="math inline">\(\nabla\)</span>’s), and checking your result against a finite-difference approximation.</p>

<h1>Differentiating ODE solutions</h1>
<p>In this lecture, we will consider the problem of differentiating the <em>solution</em> of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with respect to parameters that appear in the equations and/or initial conditions. This is as important topic in a surprising number of practical applications, such as evaluating the effect of uncertainties, fitting experimental data, or machine learning (which is increasingly combining ODE models with neural networks). As in previous lectures, we will find that there are crucial practical distinctions between “forward” and “reverse” (“adjoint”) techniques for computing these derivatives, depending upon the number of parameters and desired outputs.</p>
<p>Although a basic familiarity with the concept of an ODE will be helpful to readers of this lecture, we will begin with a short review in order to establish our notation and terminology.</p>
<p>The video lecture on this topic for IAP 2023 was given by Dr.&nbsp;Frank Schäfer (MIT). These notes follow the same basic approach, but differ in some minor notational details.</p>
<section id="ordinary-differential-equations-odes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ordinary-differential-equations-odes">Ordinary differential equations (ODEs)</h2>
<p>An <strong>ordinary differential equation</strong> (<strong>ODE</strong>) is an equation for a function <span class="math inline">\(u(t)\)</span> of “time”<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> <span class="math inline">\(t\in\mathbb{R}\)</span> in terms of one or more derivatives, most commonly in the <strong>first-order</strong> form <span class="math display">\[\frac{du}{dt}=f(u,t)\]</span> for some right-hand-side function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. Note that <span class="math inline">\(u(t)\)</span> need not be a scalar function—it could be a column vector <span class="math inline">\(u\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\)</span>, a matrix, or any other differentiable object. One could also write ODEs in terms of higher derivatives <span class="math inline">\(d^{2}u/dt^{2}\)</span> and so on, but it turns out that one can write any ODE in terms of first derivatives alone, simply by making <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> a vector with more components.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> To uniquely determine a solution of a first-order ODE, we need some additional information, typically an <strong>initial value</strong> <span class="math inline">\(u(0)=u_{0}\)</span> (the value of <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span>), in which case it is called an <strong>initial-value problem</strong>. These facts, and many other properties of ODEs, are reviewed in detail by many textbooks on differential equations, as well as in classes like 18.03 at MIT.</p>
<p>ODEs are important for a huge variety of applications, because the behavior of many realistic systems is defined in terms of rates of change (derivatives). For example, you may recall Newton’s laws of mechanics, in which acceleration (the derivative of velocity) is related to force (which may be a function of time, position, and/or velocity), and the solution <span class="math inline">\(u=[\text{position},\text{velocity}]\)</span> of the corresponding ODE tells us the trajectory of the system. In chemistry, <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> might represent the concentrations of one or more reactant molecules, with the right-hand side <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> providing reaction rates. In finance, there are ODE-like models of stock or option prices. <em>Partial</em> differential equations (PDEs) are more complicated versions of the same idea, for example in which <span class="math inline">\(u(x,t)\)</span> is a function of space <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> as well as time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and one has <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=f(u,x,t)\)</span> in which <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> may involve some spatial derivatives of <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>.</p>
<p>In linear algebra (e.g.&nbsp;18.06 at MIT), we often consider initial-value problems for <em>linear</em> ODEs of the form <span class="math inline">\(du/dt=Au\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is a column vector and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is a square matrix; if <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is a constant matrix (independent of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>), then the solution <span class="math inline">\(u(t)=e^{At}u(0)\)</span> can be described in terms of a matrix exponential <span class="math inline">\(e^{At}\)</span>. More generally, there are many tricks to find explicit solutions of various sorts of ODEs (various functions <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>). However, just as one cannot find explicit formulas for the integrals of most functions, there is no explicit formula for the solution of <em>most</em> ODEs, and in many practical applications one must resort to approximate numerical solutions. Fortunately, if you supply a computer program that can compute <span class="math inline">\(f(u,t)\)</span>, there are mature and sophisticated software libraries<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> which can compute <span class="math inline">\(u(t)\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(u(0)\)</span> for any desired set of times <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, to any desired level of accuracy (for example, to 8 significant digits).</p>
<p>For example, the most basic numerical ODE method computes the solution at a sequence of times <span class="math inline">\(t_{n}=n\Delta t\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(n=0,1,2,\ldots\)</span> simply by approximating <span class="math inline">\(\frac{du}{dt}=f(u,t)\)</span> using the finite difference <span class="math inline">\(\frac{u(t_{n+1})-u(t_{n})}{\Delta t}\approx f(u(t_{n}),t_{n})\)</span>, giving us the “explicit” timestep algorithm: <span class="math display">\[u(t_{n+1})\approx u(t_{n})+\Delta t\,f(u(t_{n}),t_{n}).\]</span> Using this technique, known as “Euler’s method,” we can march the solution forward in time: starting from our initial condition <span class="math inline">\(u_{0}\)</span>, we compute <span class="math inline">\(u(t_1) = u(\Delta t)\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(u(t_2) = u(2\Delta t)\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(u(\Delta t)\)</span>, and so forth. Of course, this might be rather inaccurate unless we make <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span> very small, necessitating many timesteps to reach a given time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, and there can arise other subtleties like “instabilities” where the error may accumulate exponentially rapidly with each timestep. It turns out that Euler’s method is mostly obsolete: there are much more sophisticated algorithms that robustly produce accurate solutions with far less computational cost. However, they all resemble Euler’s method in the conceptual sense: they use evaluations of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> at a few nearby times <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> to “extrapolate” <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> at a subsequent time somehow, and thus march the solution forwards through time.</p>
<p>Relying on a computer to obtain numerical solutions to ODEs is practically essential, but it can also make ODEs a lot more fun to work with. If you ever took a class on ODEs, you may remember a lot of tedious labor (tricky integrals, polynomial roots, systems of equations, integrating factors, etc.) to obtain solutions by hand. Instead, we can focus here on simply setting up the correct ODEs and integrals and trust the computer to do the rest.</p>

Here, we show a simple example <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = -pu\)</span>, whose solution <span class="math inline">\(u(p,t) = e^{-p t} u(p,0)\)</span> is known analytically, and show the change <span class="math inline">\(\delta u\)</span> from changing <span class="math inline">\(p=1\)</span> to by <span class="math inline">\(\delta p = 0.1\)</span>.</figcaption>

</div>
<p>Often, ODEs depend on some additional parameters <span class="math inline">\(p\in\mathbb{R}^{N}\)</span> (or some other vector space). For example, these might be reaction-rate coefficients in a chemistry problem, the masses of particles in a mechanics problem, the entries of the matrix <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> in a linear ODE, and so on. So, you really have a problem of the form <span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=f(u,p,t),\]</span> where the solution <span class="math inline">\(u(p,t)\)</span> depends both on time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and the parameters <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, and in which the initial condition <span class="math inline">\(u(p,0)=u_{0}(p)\)</span> may also depend on the parameters.</p>
<p>The question is, how can we compute the derivative <span class="math inline">\(\partial u/\partial p\)</span> of the solution with respect to the parameters of the ODE? By this, as usual, we mean the linear operator that gives the first-order change in <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> for a change in <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, as depicted in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:ode" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:ode">6</a>: <span class="math display">\[u(p+dp,t)-u(p,t)=\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}[dp] \qquad \mbox{(an }n\mbox{-component infinitesimal vector)},\]</span> where of course <span class="math inline">\(\partial u/\partial p\)</span> (which can be thought of as an <span class="math inline">\(n \times N\)</span> Jacobian matrix) depends on <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. This kind of question is commonplace. For example, it is important in:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Uncertainty quantification (UQ): if you have some uncertainty in the parameters of your ODE (for example, you have a chemical reaction in which the reaction rates are only known experimentally <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> some measurement errors), the derivative <span class="math inline">\(\partial u/\partial p\)</span> tells you (to first order, at least) how sensitive your answer is to each of these uncertainties.</p></li>
<li><p>Optimization and fitting: often, you want to choose the parameters <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> to maximize or minimize some objective (or “loss” in machine learning). For example, if your ODE models some chemical reaction with unknown reaction rates or other parameters <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, you might want to <em>fit</em> the parameters <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> to minimize the difference between <span class="math inline">\(u(p,t)\)</span> and some experimentally observed concentrations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the latter case of optimization, you have a <strong>scalar objective function</strong> of the solution, since to minimize or maximize something you need a real number (and <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> might be a vector). For example, this could take on one of the following two forms:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A real-valued function <span class="math inline">\(g(u(p,T),T) \in \mathbb{R}\)</span> that depends on the solution <span class="math inline">\(u(p,T)\)</span> at a particular time <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. For example, if you have an experimental solution <span class="math inline">\(u_{*}(t)\)</span> that you are are trying to match at <span class="math inline">\(t=T\)</span>, you might minimize <span class="math inline">\(g(u(p,T),T)=\Vert u(p,T)-u_{*}(T)\Vert^{2}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>A real-valued function <span class="math inline">\(G(p)=\int_{0}^{T}g(u(p,t),t)dt\)</span> that depends on an average (here scaled by <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>) over many times <span class="math inline">\(t\in(0,T)\)</span> of our time-dependent <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>. In the example of fitting experimental data <span class="math inline">\(u_{*}(t)\)</span>, minimizing <span class="math inline">\(G(p)=\int_{0}^{T}\Vert u(p,t)-u_{*}(t)\Vert^{2}dt\)</span> corresponds to a least-square fit to minimize the error averaged over a time <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> (e.g.&nbsp;the duration of your experiment).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>More generally, you can give more weight to certain times than others by including a non-negative weight function <span class="math inline">\(w(t)\)</span> in the integral: <span class="math display">\[G_w(p)=\int_0^\infty \underbrace{\|u(p,t)-u_*(t)\|^2}_{g(u(p,t),t)}  \, w(t) \, dt , .\]</span> The two cases above are simply the choices <span class="math inline">\(w(t) = \delta(t-T)\)</span> (a Dirac delta function) and <span class="math inline">\(w(t) = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; t \le T \\ 0 &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases}\)</span> (a&nbsp;step function), respectively. As discussed in Problem&nbsp;<a href="#prob:discrete-data" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="prob:discrete-data">[prob:discrete-data]</a>, you can let <span class="math inline">\(w(t)\)</span> be a sum of delta functions to represent data at a sequence of discrete times.</p>
<p>In both cases, since these are scalar-valued functions, for optimization/fitting one would like to know the gradient <span class="math inline">\(\nabla_{p}g\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\nabla_{p}G\)</span>, such that, as usual, <span class="math display">\[g(u(p+dp,t),t)-g(u(p,t),t)=\left(\nabla_{p}g\right)^{T}dp\]</span> so that <span class="math inline">\(\pm\nabla_{p}g\)</span> is the steepest ascent/descent direction for maximization/minimization of <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, respectively. It is worth emphasizing that gradients (which we only define for scalar-valued functions) have the same shape as their inputs&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(\nabla_p g\)</span> is a vector of length <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> (the number of parameters) that depends on <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p>
<p>These are “just derivatives,” but probably you can see the difficulty: if we don’t have a formula (explicit solution) for <span class="math inline">\(u(p,t)\)</span>, only some numerical software that can crank out numbers for <span class="math inline">\(u(p,t)\)</span> given any parameters&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, how do we apply differentiation rules to find <span class="math inline">\(\partial u/\partial p\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\nabla_{p}g\)</span>? Of course, we could use finite differences as in Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:finitedifference" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:finitedifference">4</a>—just crank through numerical solutions for <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p+\delta p\)</span> and subtract them—but that will be quite slow if we want to differentiate with respect to many parameters (<span class="math inline">\(N\gg1\)</span>), not to mention giving potentially poor accuracy. In fact, people often have <em>huge</em> numbers of parameters inside an ODE that they want to differentiate. Nowadays, our right-hand-side function <span class="math inline">\(f(u,p,t)\)</span> can even contain a <em>neural network</em> (this is called a “neural ODE”) with thousands or millions (<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>) of parameters <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, and we need all <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> of these derivatives <span class="math inline">\(\nabla_{p}g\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\nabla_{p}G\)</span> to minimize the “loss” function <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. So, not only do we need to find a way to differentiate our ODE solutions (or scalar functions thereof), but these derivatives must be obtained <em>efficiently</em>. It turns out that there are two ways to do this, and both of them hinge on the fact that the derivative is obtained by <em>solving another ODE</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Forward</strong> mode: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\)</span> turns out to solve <em>another</em> ODE that we can integrate with the same numerical solvers for <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>. This gives us all of the derivatives we could want, but the drawback is that the ODE for <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\)</span> is larger by a factor of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> than the original ODE for <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, so it is only practical for small <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> (few parameters).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reverse</strong> (“<strong>adjoint</strong>”) mode: for scalar objectives, it turns out that <span class="math inline">\(\nabla_{p}g\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\nabla_{p}G\)</span> can be computed by solving a different ODE for an “adjoint” solution <span class="math inline">\(v(p,t)\)</span> of the <em>same size</em> as <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, and then computing some simple integrals involving <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> (the “forward” solution) and <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>. This has the advantage of giving us all <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> derivatives with only about <em>twice</em> the cost of solving for <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, regardless of the number <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> of parameters. The disadvantage is that, since it turns out that <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> must be integrated “backwards” in time (starting from an “initial” condition at <span class="math inline">\(t=T\)</span> and working back to <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span>) and depends on <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, it is necessary to store <span class="math inline">\(u(p,t)\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(t\in[0,T]\)</span> (rather than marching <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> forwards in time and discarding values from previous times when they are no longer needed), which can require a vast amount of computer memory for large ODE systems integrated over long times.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will now consider each of these approaches in more detail.</p>
<section id="forward-sensitivity-analysis-of-odes" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="forward-sensitivity-analysis-of-odes">Forward sensitivity analysis of ODEs</h3>
<p>Let us start with our ODE <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=f(u,p,t)\)</span>, and consider what happens to <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> for a small change <span class="math inline">\(dp\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
d\underbrace{\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}\right)}_{=f(u,p,t)} &amp;= \frac{\partial}{\partial t} (du)

\frac{\partial}{\partial t}
\left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial p} [ dp ]\right)=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\right)[dp] \\
&amp;=d(f(u,p,t)) = \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial u}\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial p}\right)[dp],
\end{aligned}\]</span> where we have used the familiar rule (from multivariable calculus) of interchanging the order of partial derivatives—a property that we will re-derive explicitly for our generalized linear-operator derivatives in our lecture on Hessians and second derivatives. Equating the right-hand sides of the two lines, we see that we have an ODE <span class="math display">\[\boxed{\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\right)=\frac{\partial f}{\partial u}\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial p}}\]</span> for the derivative <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\)</span>, whose initial condition is obtained simply by differentiating the initial condition <span class="math inline">\(u(p,0)=u_{0}(p)\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\left.\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\right|_{t=0}=\frac{\partial u_{0}}{\partial p}.\]</span> We can therefore plug this into any ODE solver technique (usually numerical methods, unless we are extremely lucky and can solve this ODE analytically for a particular <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>) to find <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\)</span> at any desired time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Simple, right?</p>
<p>The only thing that might seem a little weird here is the <em>shape</em> of the solution: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\)</span> is a linear operator, but how can the solution of an ODE be a linear operator? It turns out that there is nothing wrong with this, but it is helpful to think about a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(u,p\in\mathbb{R}\)</span> are scalars (that is, we have a single scalar ODE with a single scalar parameter), then <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\)</span> is just a (time-dependent) number, and our ODE for <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\)</span> is an ordinary scalar ODE with an ordinary scalar initial condition.</p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(u\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\)</span> (a “system” of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> ODEs) and <span class="math inline">\(p\in\mathbb{R}\)</span> is a scalar, then <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\)</span> is another column vector and our ODE for <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\)</span> is another system of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> ODEs. So, we solve two ODEs of the same size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> to obtain <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(u\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\)</span> (a “system” of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> ODEs) and <span class="math inline">\(p\in\mathbb{R}^{N}\)</span> is a vector of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> parameters, then <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times N}\)</span> is an <span class="math inline">\(n\times N\)</span> Jacobian <em>matrix.</em> Our ODE for <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\)</span> is effectivly system of <span class="math inline">\(nN\)</span> ODEs for all the components of this matrix, with a matrix <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial u_{0}}{\partial p}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(nN\)</span> initial conditions! Solving this “matrix ODE” with numerical methods poses no conceptual difficulty, but will generally require about <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> times the computational work of solving for <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, simply because there are <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> times as many unknowns. This could be expensive if <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is large!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This reflects our general observation of forward-mode differentiation: it is expensive when the number <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> of “input” parameters being differentiated is large. However, forward mode is straightforward and, especially for <span class="math inline">\(N\lesssim100\)</span> or so, is often the first method to try when differentiating ODE solutions. Given <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\)</span> , one can then straightforwardly differentiate scalar objectives by the chain rule: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\left.\nabla_{p}g\right|_{t=T} &amp; =\left.\underbrace{\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}^{T}}_{\text{Jacobian}^{T}}\underbrace{\frac{\partial g}{\partial u}^{T}}_{\text{vector}}\right|_{t=T},\\
\nabla_{p}G &amp; =\int_{0}^{T}\nabla_{p}g\,dt.
\end{aligned}\]</span> The left-hand side <span class="math inline">\(\nabla_p G\)</span> is gradient of a scalar function of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> parameters, and hence the gradient is a vector of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> components. Correspondingly, the right-hand side is an integral of an <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-component gradient <span class="math inline">\(\nabla_p g\)</span> as well, and the integral of a vector-valued function can be viewed as simply the elementwise integral (the vector of integrals of each component).</p>

<section id="reverseadjoint-sensitivity-analysis-of-odes" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reverseadjoint-sensitivity-analysis-of-odes">Reverse/adjoint sensitivity analysis of ODEs</h3>
<p>For large <span class="math inline">\(N\gg1\)</span> and scalar objectives <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> (etc.), we can in principle compute derivatives <em>much</em> more efficiently, with about the same cost as computing <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, by applying a “reverse-mode” or “adjoint” approach. In other lectures, we’ve obtained analogous reverse-mode methods simply by evaluating the chain rule left-to-right (outputs-to-inputs) instead of right-to-left. Conceptually, the process for ODEs is similar,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> but algebraically the derivation is rather trickier and less direct. The key thing is that, if possible, we want to avoid computing <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\)</span> explicitly, since this could be a prohibitively large Jacobian matrix if we have many parameters (<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is large), especially if we have many equations (<span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is large).</p>
<p>In particular, let’s start with our forward-mode sensitivity analysis, and consider the derivative <span class="math inline">\(G'=(\nabla_{p}G)^{T}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is the integral of a time-varying objective <span class="math inline">\(g(u,p,t)\)</span> (which we allow to depend explicitly on <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> for generality). By the chain rule, <span class="math display">\[G'=\int_{0}^{T}\left(\frac{\partial g}{\partial p}+\frac{\partial g}{\partial u}\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\right)dt,\]</span> which involves our unwanted factor <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\)</span>. To get rid of this, we’re going to use a “weird trick”</p>
<p>(much like Lagrange multipliers) of adding <em>zero</em> to this equation: <span class="math display">\[G'=\int_{0}^{T}\left[\left(\frac{\partial g}{\partial p}+\frac{\partial g}{\partial u}\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\right)+v^{T}\underbrace{\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\right)-\frac{\partial f}{\partial u}\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}-\frac{\partial f}{\partial p}\right)}_{=0}\right]dt\]</span> for some function <span class="math inline">\(v(t)\)</span> of the <em>same shape as u</em> that multiplies our “forward-mode” equation for <span class="math inline">\(\partial u/ \partial p\)</span>. (If <span class="math inline">\(u\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(v\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\)</span>; more generally, for other vector spaces, read <span class="math inline">\(v^{T}\)</span> as an inner product with <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>.) The new term <span class="math inline">\(v^T (\cdots)\)</span> is zero because the parenthesized expression is precisely the ODE satisfied by <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\)</span>, as obtained in our forward-mode analysis above, <em>regardless</em> of <span class="math inline">\(v(t)\)</span>. This is important because it allows us the freedom to <em>choose</em> <span class="math inline">\(v(t)\)</span> to <em>cancel</em> the unwanted <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\)</span> term. In particular, if we first <em>integrate by parts</em> on the <span class="math inline">\(v^{T}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\right)\)</span> term to change it to <span class="math inline">\(-\left(\frac{\partial v}{\partial t}\right)^{T}\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\)</span> plus a boundary term, then re-group the terms, we find: <span class="math display">\[G'=\left.v^{T}\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\right|_{0}^{T}+\int_{0}^{T}\left[\frac{\partial g}{\partial p}-v^{T}\frac{\partial f}{\partial p}+\underbrace{\left(\frac{\partial g}{\partial u}-v^{T}\frac{\partial f}{\partial u}-\left(\frac{\partial v}{\partial t}\right)^{T}\right)}_{\text{want to be zero!}}\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\right]dt\:.\]</span> If we could now set the <span class="math inline">\((\cdots)\)</span> term to zero, then the unwanted <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\)</span> would vanish from the integral calculation in <span class="math inline">\(G'\)</span>. We can accomplish this by <em>choosing</em> <span class="math inline">\(v(t)\)</span> (which could be <em>anything</em> up to now) to satisfy the <strong>“adjoint” ODE</strong>: <span class="math display">\[\boxed{\frac{\partial v}{\partial t}=\left(\frac{\partial g}{\partial u}\right)^{T} - \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial u}\right)^{T}v}.\]</span> What initial condition should we choose for <span class="math inline">\(v(t)\)</span>? Well, we can use this choice to get rid of the boundary term we obtained above from integration by parts: <span class="math display">\[\left.v^{T}\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\right|_{0}^{T}=v(T)^{T}\underbrace{\left.\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\right|_{T}}_{\text{unknown}}-v(0)^{T}\underbrace{\frac{\partial u_{0}}{\partial p}}_{\text{known}}.\]</span> Here, the unknown <span class="math inline">\(\left.\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\right|_{T}\)</span> term is a problem—to compute that, we would be forced to go back to integrating our big <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\)</span> ODE from forward mode. The other term is okay: since the initial condition <span class="math inline">\(u_{0}\)</span> is always given, we should know its dependence on <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> explicitly (and we will simply have <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial u_{0}}{\partial p}=0\)</span> in the common case where the initial conditions don’t depend on <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>). To eliminate the <span class="math inline">\(\left.\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\right|_{T}\)</span> term, therefore, we make the choice <span class="math display">\[\boxed{v(T)=0}.\]</span> Instead of an <em>initial</em> condition, our adjoint ODE has a <strong>final condition</strong>. That’s no problem for a numerical solver: it just means that the <strong>adjoint ODE is integrated</strong> <strong><em>backwards</em></strong> <strong>in time</strong>, starting from <span class="math inline">\(t=T\)</span> and working down to <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span>. Once we have solved the adjoint ODE for <span class="math inline">\(v(t)\)</span>, we can plug it into our equation for <span class="math inline">\(G'\)</span> to obtain our gradient by a simple integral: <span class="math display">\[\nabla_{p}G=\left(G'\right)^{T}=-\left(\frac{\partial u_{0}}{\partial p}\right)^{T}v(0)+\int_{0}^{T}\left[\left(\frac{\partial g}{\partial p}\right)^{T}-\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial p}\right)^{T}v\right]dt\:.\]</span> (If you want to be fancy, you can compute this <span class="math inline">\(\int_{0}^{T}\)</span> simultaneously with <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> itself, by augmenting the adjoint ODE with an additional set of unknowns and equations representing the <span class="math inline">\(G'\)</span> integrand. But that’s mainly just a computational convenience and doesn’t change anything fundamental about the process.)</p>
<p>The only remaining annoyance is that the adjoint ODE depends on <span class="math inline">\(u(p,t)\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(t\in[0,T]\)</span>. Normally, if we are solving the “forward” ODE for <span class="math inline">\(u(p,t)\)</span> numerically, we can “march” the solution <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> forwards in time and only store the solution at a few of the most recent timesteps. Since the adjoint ODE starts at <span class="math inline">\(t=T\)</span>, however, we can only start integrating <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> after we have completed the calculation of <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>. This requires us to save essentially <em>all</em> of our previously computed <span class="math inline">\(u(p,t)\)</span> values, so that we can evaluate <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> at arbitrary times <span class="math inline">\(t\in[0,T]\)</span> during the integration of <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> (and <span class="math inline">\(G'\)</span>). This can require a lot of computer memory if <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is large (e.g.&nbsp;it could represent <em>millions</em> of grid points from a spatially discretized PDE, such as in a heat-diffusion problem) and many timesteps <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> were required. To ameliorate this challenge, a variety of strategies have been employed, typically centered around “checkpointing” techniques in which <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is only saved at a subset of times <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, and its value at other times is obtained during the <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> integration by <em>re-computing</em> <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> as needed (numerically integrating the ODE starting at the closest “checkpoint” time). A detailed discussion of such techniques lies outside the scope of these notes, however.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="example" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example">Example</h2>
<p>Let us illustrate the above techniques with a simple example. Suppose that we are integrating the scalar ODE <span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=f(u,p,t)=p_{1}+p_{2}u+p_{3}u^{2}=p^{T}\left(\begin{array}{c}
1\\

(This is probably simple enough to solve in closed form, but we won’t bother with that here.) We will also consider the scalar function <span class="math display">\[G(p)=\int_{0}^{T}\underbrace{\left[u(p,t)-u_{*}(t)\right]^{2}}_{g(u,p,t)}dt\]</span> that (for example) we may want to minimize for some given <span class="math inline">\(u_{*}(t)\)</span> (e.g.&nbsp;experimental data or some given formula like <span class="math inline">\(u_{*}=t^{3}\)</span>), so we are hoping to compute <span class="math inline">\(\nabla_{p}G\)</span>.</p>
<section id="forward-mode" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="forward-mode">Forward mode</h3>
<p>The Jacobian matrix <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial p_{1}} &amp; \frac{\partial u}{\partial p_{2}} &amp; \frac{\partial u}{\partial p_{3}}\end{array}\right)\)</span> is simply a row vector, and satisfies our “forward-mode” ODE: <span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}\right)=\frac{\partial f}{\partial u}\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial p}=\left(p_{2}+2p_{3}u\right)\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}+\left(\begin{array}{ccc}

This is an inhomogeneous system of three coupled <em>linear</em> ODEs, which might look more conventional if we simply transpose both sides: <span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\underbrace{\left(\begin{array}{c}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial p_{1}}\\
\frac{\partial u}{\partial p_{2}}\\
\frac{\partial u}{\partial p_{3}}

\frac{\partial u}{\partial p_{1}}\\
\frac{\partial u}{\partial p_{2}}\\
\frac{\partial u}{\partial p_{3}}
\end{array}\right)+\left(\begin{array}{c}
1\\
u\\
u^{2}
\end{array}\right).\]</span> The fact that this depends on our “forward” solution <span class="math inline">\(u(p,t)\)</span> makes it not so easy to solve by hand, but a computer can solve it numerically with no difficulty. On a computer, we would probably solve for <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\partial u/ \partial p\)</span><em>simultaneously</em> by combining the two ODEs into a single ODE with&nbsp;4 components: <span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\begin{array}{c}

<p>A classic reference on reverse/adjoint differentiation of ODEs (and generalizations thereof), using notation similar to that used today (except that the adjoint solution <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is denoted <span class="math inline">\(\lambda(t)\)</span>, in an homage to Lagrange multipliers), is Cao&nbsp;et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;(2003) (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/S1064827501380630" class="uri">https://doi.org/10.1137/S1064827501380630</a>), and a more recent review article is Sapienza&nbsp;et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;(2024) (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09699" class="uri">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09699</a>). See also the SciMLSensitivity.jl package (<a href="https://github.com/SciML/SciMLSensitivity.jl" class="uri">https://github.com/SciML/SciMLSensitivity.jl</a>) for sensitivity analysis with Chris Rackauckas’s amazing DifferentialEquations.jl software suite for numerical solution of ODEs in Julia. There is a nice 2021 YouTube lecture on adjoint sensitivity of ODEs (<a href="https://youtu.be/k6s2G5MZv-I" class="uri">https://youtu.be/k6s2G5MZv-I</a>), again using a similar notation. A discrete version of this process arises for recurrence relations, in which case one obtains a reverse-order “adjoint” recurrence relation as described in MIT course notes by S.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;Johnson (<a href="https://math.mit.edu/~stevenj/18.336/recurrence2.pdf" class="uri">https://math.mit.edu/~stevenj/18.336/recurrence2.pdf</a>).</p>
<p>The differentiation methods in this chapter (e.g.&nbsp;for <span class="math inline">\(\partial u/\partial p\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\nabla_p G\)</span>) are derived assuming that the ODEs are solved exactly: given the exact ODE for <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, we derived an exact ODE for the derivative. On a computer, you will solve these forward and adjoint ODEs approximately, and in consequence the resulting derivatives will only be approximately correct (to the tolerance specified by your ODE solver). This is known as a <strong>differentiate-then-discretize</strong> approach, which has the advantage of simplicity (it is independent of the numerical solution scheme) at the expense of slight inaccuracy (your approximate derivative will not exactly predict the first-order change in your approximate solution <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>). The alternative is a <strong>discretize-then-differentiate</strong> approach, in which you first approximate (“discretize”) your ODE into a discrete-time recurrence formula, and then <em>exactly</em> differentiate the recurrence. This has the advantage of exactly differentiating your approximate solution, at the expense of complexity (the derivation is specific to your discretization scheme). Various authors discuss these tradeoffs and their implications, e.g.&nbsp;in chapter&nbsp;4 of M.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;Gunzburger’s <a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9780898718720.ch4"><em>Perspectives in Flow Control and Optimization</em></a> (2002) or in papers like <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s00158-013-1024-4">Jensen&nbsp;et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;(2014)</a>.</p>

<div class="example">
<p>For example, consider functions <span class="math inline">\(u(x)\)</span> that map <span class="math inline">\(x\in [0,1] \to u(x) \in \R\)</span>. We may then define the function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[f(u) = \int_0^1 \sin (u(x)) \,\mathrm{d} x.\]</span> Such a function, mapping an input <em>function</em> <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> to an output <em>number</em>, is sometimes called a “functional.” What is <span class="math inline">\(f'\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span> in this case?</p>
</div>
<p>Recall that, given any function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, we always define the derivative as a linear operator <span class="math inline">\(f'(u)\)</span> via the equation: <span class="math display">\[df = f (u + du ) - f(u) = f'(u) [du] \, ,\]</span> where now <span class="math inline">\(du\)</span> denotes an arbitrary “small-valued” <em>function</em> <span class="math inline">\(du(x)\)</span> that represents a small change in <span class="math inline">\(u(x)\)</span>, as depicted in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:du" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:du">7</a> for the analogous case of a non-infinitesimal <span class="math inline">\(\delta u(x)\)</span>.

<section id="inner-products-of-functions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="inner-products-of-functions">Inner products of functions</h2>
<p>In order to define a gradient <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span> when studying such “functionals” (maps from functions to <span class="math inline">\(\R\)</span>), it is natural to ask if there is an inner product on the input space. In fact, there are perfectly good ways to define inner products of functions! Given functions <span class="math inline">\(u(x), v(x)\)</span> defined on <span class="math inline">\(x\in [0,1]\)</span>, we could define a “Euclidean” inner product: <span class="math display">\[\langle u, v \rangle = \int_0^1 u(x) v(x) \,\mathrm dx.\]</span> Notice that this implies <span class="math display">\[\lVert u \rVert := \sqrt{\langle u, u \rangle} = \sqrt{\int_0^1 u(x)^2 dx} \, .\]</span></p>
<p>Recall that the gradient <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span> is <em>defined</em> as whatever we take the inner product of <span class="math inline">\(du\)</span> with to obtain <span class="math inline">\(df\)</span>. Therefore, we obtain the gradient as follows: <span class="math display">\[df = f'(u)[du]  = \int_0^1 \cos(u(x)) \,du(x)\, dx  = \langle \nabla f, du \rangle \implies \nabla f = \cos (u(x)) \, .\]</span> The two infinitesimals <span class="math inline">\(du\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> may seem a bit disconcerting, but if this is confusing you can just think of the <span class="math inline">\(du(x)\)</span> as a small non-infinitesimal function <span class="math inline">\(\delta u(x)\)</span> (as in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:du" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:du">7</a>) for which we are dropping higher-order terms.</p>
<p>The gradient <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span> is just another function, <span class="math inline">\(\cos(u(x))\)</span>! As usual, <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span> has the same “shape” as <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>.</p>
<div class="proof remark">
<p><span class="proof-title"><em>Remark</em>. </span>It might be instructive here to compare the gradient of an integral, above, with a discretized version where the integral is replaced by a sum. If we have <span class="math display">\[f(u) = \sum_{k=1}^n \sin(u_k) \Delta x \,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta x = 1/n\)</span>, for a vector <span class="math inline">\(u \in \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>, related to our previous <span class="math inline">\(u(x)\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(u_k = u(k\Delta x)\)</span>, which can be thought of as a “rectangle rule” (or Riemann sum, or Euler) approximation for the integral. Then, <span class="math display">\[\nabla_u f = \begin{pmatrix} \cos(u_1) \\ \cos(u_2) \\ \vdots \end{pmatrix} \Delta x  \, .\]</span> Why does this discrete version have a <span class="math inline">\(\Delta x\)</span> multiplying the gradient, whereas our continuous version did not? The reason is that in the continuous version we effectively included the <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> in the definition of the inner product <span class="math inline">\(\langle u, v \rangle\)</span> (which was an integral). In discrete case, the ordinary inner product (used to define the conventional gradient) is just a sum without a <span class="math inline">\(\Delta x\)</span>. However, if we define a <em>weighted</em> discrete inner product <span class="math inline">\(\langle u, v \rangle = \sum_{k=1}^n u_k v_k \Delta x\)</span>, then, according to Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:generalvectorspaces" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:generalvectorspaces">5</a>, this changes the definition of the gradient, and in fact will remove the <span class="math inline">\(\Delta x\)</span> term to correspond to the continuous version.</p>

<section id="example-minimizing-arc-length" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-minimizing-arc-length">Example: Minimizing arc length</h2>
<p>We now consider a more tricky example with an intuitive geometric interpretation.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> be a differentiable function on <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> and consider the functional <span class="math display">\[f(u) = \int_0^1 \sqrt{1+ u'(x)^2}\,dx.\]</span> Solve for <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(u(0) = u(1) = 0.\)</span></p>
</div>
<p>Geometrically, you learned in first-year calculus that this is simply the <strong>length of the curve</strong> <span class="math inline">\(u(x)\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(x=1\)</span>. To differentiate this, first notice that ordinary single-variable calculus gives us the linearization <span class="math display">\[d\left( \sqrt{1 + v^2} \right) = \sqrt{1+ (v + dv)^2} - \sqrt{1 + v^2} = \left( \sqrt{1 + v^2} \right)' dv =  \frac{v}{\sqrt{1+ v^2}} dv \, .\]</span> Therefore, <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
   df &amp;= f(u+ du) - f(u) \\
   &amp;= \int_0^1 \left( \sqrt{1 + (u+du)'^2} - \sqrt{1 + u'^2} \right) dx \\
   &amp;= \int_0^1 \frac{u'}{\sqrt{1 + u'^2}} \, du'  dx.
\end{aligned}\]</span> However, this is a linear operator on <span class="math inline">\(du'\)</span> and not (directly) on <span class="math inline">\(du\)</span>. Abstractly, this is fine, because <span class="math inline">\(du'\)</span> is itself a linear operation on <span class="math inline">\(du\)</span>, so we have <span class="math inline">\(f'(u)[du]\)</span> as the composition of two linear operations. However, it is more revealing to rewrite it explicitly in terms of <span class="math inline">\(du\)</span>, for example in order to define <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span>. To accomplish this, we can apply <em>integration by parts</em> to obtain <span class="math display">\[f'(u) [du] = \int_0^1 \frac{u'}{\sqrt{1 + u'^2}} \, du' dx = \left. \frac{u'}{\sqrt{1 + u'^2}} du \right|_0^1 - \int_0^1 \left(\frac{u'}{\sqrt{1 + u'^2}}\right)' \, du \, dx \, .\]</span></p>
<p>Notice that up until now we did not need utilize the “boundary conditions” <span class="math inline">\(u(0) = u(1) = 0\)</span> for this calculation. However, if we want to restrict ourselves to such functions <span class="math inline">\(u(x)\)</span>, then our perturbation <span class="math inline">\(du\)</span> cannot change the endpoint values, i.e.&nbsp;we must have <span class="math inline">\(du(0) = du(1) = 0\)</span>. (Geometrically, suppose that we want to find the <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> that minimizes arc length between <span class="math inline">\((0,0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((1,0)\)</span>, so that we need to fix the endpoints.) This implies that the boundary term in the above equation is zero. Hence, we have that <span class="math display">\[df = -\int_0^1 \underbrace{\left(\frac{u'}{\sqrt{1 + u'^2}}\right)'}_{\nabla f} \, du \, dx = \langle \nabla f , du \rangle \, .\]</span></p>
<p>Furthermore, note that the <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> that minimizes the functional <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> has the property that <span class="math inline">\(\left. \nabla f \right|_u = 0\)</span>. Therefore, for a <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> that minimizes the functional <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> (the <em>shortest curve</em>), we must have the following result: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    0 = \nabla f &amp;= -\left(\frac{u'}{\sqrt{1 + u'^2}}\right)' \\
    &amp;= -\frac{u'' \sqrt{1 + u'^2} - u' \frac{u'' u '}{\sqrt{1 + u'^2}}}{ 1 + u'^2} \\
    &amp;= -\frac{u'' ( 1 + u'^2) - u'' u'^2}{(1 + u'^2)^{3/2}} \\
    &amp;= -\frac{u''}{( 1+ u'^2)^{3/2}}.
\end{aligned}\]</span> Hence, <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f = 0 \implies u''(x) = 0 \implies u(x) = ax + b\)</span> for constants <span class="math inline">\(a,b\)</span>; and for these boundary conditions <span class="math inline">\(a=b=0\)</span>. In other words, <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is the horizontal straight line segment!</p>
<p>Thus, we have recovered the familiar result that straight line segments in <span class="math inline">\(\R^2\)</span> are the shortest curves between two points!</p>
<div class="proof remark">
<p><span class="proof-title"><em>Remark</em>. </span>Notice that the expression <span class="math inline">\(\frac{u''}{(1+ u'^2)^{3/2}}\)</span> is the formula from multivariable calculus for the curvature of the curve defined by <span class="math inline">\(y= u(x)\)</span>. It is not a coincidence that the gradient of arc length is the (negative) curvature, and the minimum arc length occurs for zero gradient = zero curvature.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="eulerlagrange-equations">Euler–Lagrange equations</h2>
<p>This style of calculation is part of the subject known as the <strong>calculus of variations</strong>. Of course, the final answer in the example above (a straight line) may have been obvious, but a similar approach can be applied to many more interesting problems. We can generalize the approach as follows:</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(f(u) = \int_a^b F(u, u', x) \, dx\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is a differentiable function on <span class="math inline">\([a,b]\)</span>. Suppose the endpoints of <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> are fixed (i.e.&nbsp;its values at <span class="math inline">\(x=a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x=b\)</span> are constants). Let us calculate <span class="math inline">\(df\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>We find: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    df &amp;= f(u + du) - f(u) \\
    &amp;= \int_a^b \left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial u} du  + \frac{\partial F}{\partial u'} du' \right) dx \\
    &amp;= \underbrace{\frac{\partial F}{\partial u'} du \bigr|_a^b}_{= 0} + \int_a^b \left( \frac{\partial F}{\partial u} - \left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial u'}\right)'\right) \, du \, dx \, ,
\end{aligned}\]</span> where we used the fact that <span class="math inline">\(du = 0\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> if the endpoints <span class="math inline">\(u(a)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(u(b)\)</span> are fixed. Hence, <span class="math display">\[\nabla f = \frac{\partial F}{\partial u} - \left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial u'}\right)',\]</span> which equals zero at extremum. Notice that <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f = 0\)</span> yields a second-order differential equation in <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Lagrange_equation">Euler–Lagrange equations</a>!</p>
<div class="proof remark">
<p><span class="proof-title"><em>Remark</em>. </span>The notation <span class="math inline">\(\partial F / \partial u'\)</span> is a notoriously confusing aspect of the calculus of variations—what does it mean to take the derivative “with respect to <span class="math inline">\(u'\)</span>” while holding <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> fixed? A more explicit, albeit more verbose, way of expressing this is to think of <span class="math inline">\(F(u,v,x)\)</span> as a function of three <em>unrelated</em> arguments, for which we only substitute <span class="math inline">\(v=u'\)</span> <em>after</em> differentiating with respect to the second argument <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial F}{\partial u'} = \left. \frac{\partial F}{\partial v} \right|_{v=u'} \, .\]</span></p>

<section id="derivatives-of-random-functions" class="level1">
<h1>Derivatives of Random Functions</h1>
<p>These notes are from a guest lecture by Gaurav Arya in IAP 2023.</p>
<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this class, we’ve learned how to take derivatives of all sorts of crazy functions. Recall one of our first examples: <span class="math display">\[f(A) = A^2,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is a matrix. To differentiate this function, we had to go back to the drawing board, and ask:</p>
<div class="question">
<p>If we perturb the input slightly, how does the output change? <span id="question:perturb" data-label="question:perturb"></span></p>
</div>
<p>To this end, we wrote down something like: <span class="math display">\[\delta f = (A+\delta A)^2 - A^2 = A (\delta A) + (\delta A) A + \underbrace{(\delta A)^2}_{\text{neglected}}.\]</span> We called <span class="math inline">\(\delta f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\delta A\)</span> <em>differentials</em> in the limit where <span class="math inline">\(\delta A\)</span> became arbitrarily small. We then had to ask:</p>
<div class="question">
<p>What terms in the differential can we neglect? <span id="question:neglect" data-label="question:neglect"></span></p>
</div>
<p>We decided that <span class="math inline">\((\delta A)^2\)</span> should be neglected, justifying this by the fact that <span class="math inline">\((\delta A)^2\)</span> is “higher-order”. We were left with the derivative operator <span class="math inline">\(\delta A \mapsto
A(\delta A) + (\delta A) A\)</span>: the best possible <em>linear</em> approximation to <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> in a neighbourhood of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. At a high level, the main challenge here was dealing with complicated input and output spaces: <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> was matrix-valued, and also matrix-accepting. We had to ask ourselves: in this case, what should the notion of a derivative even mean?</p>
<p>In this lecture, we will face a similar challenge, but with an even weirder type of function. This time, the output of our function will be <em>random</em>. Now, we need to revisit the same questions. If the output is random, how can we describe its response to a change in the input? And how can we form a useful notion of derivative?</p>
</section>
<section id="stochastic-programs" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stochastic-programs">Stochastic programs</h2>
<p>More precisely, we will consider random, or <em>stochastic</em>, functions <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> with real input <span class="math inline">\(p \in \mathbb{R}\)</span> and real-valued random-variable output. As a map, we can write <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> as <span class="math display">\[p \mapsto X(p),\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(X(p)\)</span> is a random variable. (To keep things simple, we’ll take <span class="math inline">\(p \in \mathbb{R}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X(p) \in \mathbb{R}\)</span> in this chapter, though of course they could be generalized to other vector spaces as in the other chapters. For now, the randomness is complicated enough to deal with.)</p>
<p>The idea is that we can only <em>sample</em> from <span class="math inline">\(X(p)\)</span>, according to some distribution of numbers with probabilities that depend upon <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. One simple example would be sampling real numbers uniformly (equal probabilities) from the interval <span class="math inline">\([0,p]\)</span>. As a more complicated example, suppose <span class="math inline">\(X(p)\)</span> follows the <em>exponential distribution</em> with scale <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, corresponding to randomly sampled real numbers <span class="math inline">\(x \ge 0\)</span> whose probability decreases proportional to <span class="math inline">\(e^{-x/p}\)</span>. This can be denoted <span class="math inline">\(X(p) \sim \operatorname{Exp}(p)\)</span>, and implemented in Julia by:</p>
<pre class="jlcon"><code>julia&gt; using Distributions

julia&gt; sample_X(p) = rand(Exponential(p))
sample_X (generic function with 1 method)</code></pre>
<p>We can take a few samples:</p>
<pre class="jlcon"><code>julia&gt; sample_X(10.0)
1.7849785709142214

julia&gt; sample_X(10.0)
4.435847397169775

julia&gt; sample_X(10.0)
0.6823343897949835

julia&gt; mean(sample_X(10.0) for i = 1:10^9) # mean = p
9.999930348291866</code></pre>
<p>If our program gives a different output each time, what could a useful notion of derivative be? Before we try to answer this, let’s ask <em>why</em> we might want to take a derivative. The answer is that we may be very interested in <em>statistical properties</em> of random functions, i.e.&nbsp;values that can be expressed using <em>averages</em>. Even if a function is stochastic, its <em>average</em> (“expected value”), assuming the average exists, can be a deterministic function of its parameters that has a conventional derivative.</p>
<p>So, why not take the average <em>first</em>, and then take the ordinary derivative of this average? This simple approach works for very basic stochastic functions (e.g.&nbsp;the exponential distribution above has expected value <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, with derivative <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>), but runs into practical difficulties for more complicated distributions (as are commonly implemented by large computer programs working with random numbers).</p>
<div class="proof remark">
<p><span class="proof-title"><em>Remark</em>. </span>It is often much easier to produce an “unbiased estimate” <span class="math inline">\(X(p)\)</span> of a statistical quantity than to compute it exactly. (Here, an unbiased estimate means that <span class="math inline">\(X(p)\)</span> averages out to our statistical quantity of interest.)</p>
</div>
<p>For example, in deep learning, the “variational autoencoder” (VAE) is a very common architecture that is inherently stochastic. It is easy to get a stochastic <em>unbiased estimate</em> of the loss function by running a random simulation <span class="math inline">\(X(p)\)</span>: the loss function <span class="math inline">\(L(p)\)</span> is then the “average” value of <span class="math inline">\(X(p)\)</span>, denoted by the <em>expected value</em> <span class="math inline">\(\EE[X(p)]\)</span>. However, computing the loss <span class="math inline">\(L(p)\)</span> exactly would require integrating over all possible outcomes, which usually is impractical. Now, to train the VAE, we also need to differentiate <span class="math inline">\(L(p)\)</span>, i.e.&nbsp;differentiate <span class="math inline">\(\EE[X(p)]\)</span> with respect to <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>!</p>
<p>Perhaps more intuitive examples can be found in the physical sciences, where randomness may be baked into your model of a physical process. In this case, it’s hard to get around the fact that you need to deal with stochasticity! For example, you may have two particles that interact with an <em>average</em> rate of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>. But in reality, the times when these interactions actually occur follow a stochastic process. (In fact, the time until the first interaction might be exponentially distributed, with scale <span class="math inline">\(1/r\)</span>.) And if you want to (e.g.) fit the parameters of your stochastic model to real-world data, it’s once again very useful to have derivatives.</p>
<p>If we can’t compute our statistical quantity of interest exactly, it seems unreasonable to assume we can compute its derivative exactly. However, we could hope to stochastically <em>estimate</em> its derivative. That is, if <span class="math inline">\(X(p)\)</span> represents the full program that produces an unbiased estimate of our statistical quantity, here’s one property we’d definitely like our notion of derivative to have: we should be able to construct from it an unbiased gradient estimator<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> <span class="math inline">\(X'(p)\)</span> satisfying <span class="math display">\[\EE[X'(p)] = \EE[X(p)]' = \frac{\partial \EE[X(p)]}{\partial p}.\]</span> Of course, there are infinitely many such estimators. For example, given any estimator <span class="math inline">\(X'(p)\)</span> we can add any other random variable that has zero average without changing the expectation value. But in practice there are two additional considerations: (1) we want <span class="math inline">\(X'(p)\)</span> to be easy to compute/sample (about as easy as <span class="math inline">\(X(p)\)</span>), and (2) we want the <em>variance</em> (the “spread”) of <span class="math inline">\(X'(p)\)</span> to be small enough that we don’t need too many samples to estimate its average accurately (hopefully no worse than estimating <span class="math inline">\(\EE[X(p)]\)</span>).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stochastic-differentials-and-the-reparameterization-trick">Stochastic differentials and the reparameterization trick</h2>
<p>Let’s begin by answering our first question (Question <a href="#question:perturb" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="question:perturb">[question:perturb]</a>): how does <span class="math inline">\(X(p)\)</span> respond to a change in <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>? Let us consider a specific <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and write down a <em>stochastic differential</em>, taking a small but non-infinitesimal <span class="math inline">\(\delta p\)</span> to avoid thinking about infinitesimals for now: <span class="math display">\[\delta X(p) = X(p + \delta p) - X(p),\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\delta p\)</span> represents an arbitrary small change in <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. What sort of object is <span class="math inline">\(\delta X(p)\)</span>?</p>
<p>Since we’re subtracting two random variables, it ought to itself be a random variable. However, <span class="math inline">\(\delta X(p)\)</span> is still not fully specified! We have only specified the marginal distributions of <span class="math inline">\(X(p)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X(p+\delta p)\)</span>: to be able to subtract the two, we need to know their <em>joint distribution</em>.</p>
<p>One possibility is to treat <span class="math inline">\(X(p)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X(p + \delta p)\)</span> as independent. This means that <span class="math inline">\(\delta X(p)\)</span> would be constructed as the difference of independent samples. Let’s see how samples from <span class="math inline">\(\delta X(p)\)</span> would look like in this case!</p>
<pre class="jlcon"><code>julia&gt; sample_X(p) = rand(Exponential(p))
sample_X (generic function with 1 method)

julia&gt; sample_δX(p, δp) = sample_X(p + δp) - sample_X(p)
sample_δX (generic function with 1 method)

julia&gt; p = 10; δp = 1e-5;

julia&gt; sample_δX(p, δp)

julia&gt; sample_δX(p, δp)
1.2232268930932104</code></pre>
<p>We can observe something a bit worrying: even for a very tiny <span class="math inline">\(\delta p\)</span> (we chose <span class="math inline">\(\delta p = 10^{-5}\)</span>), <span class="math inline">\(\delta X(p)\)</span> is still fairly large: essentially as large as the original random variables. This is not good news if we want to construct a derivative from <span class="math inline">\(\delta X(p)\)</span>: we would rather see its magnitude getting smaller and smaller with <span class="math inline">\(\delta p\)</span>, like in the non-stochastic case. Computationally, this will make it very difficult to determine <span class="math inline">\(\EE[X(p)]'\)</span> by averaging <code>sample_δX(p, δp) / δp</code> over many samples: we’ll need a huge number of samples because the <em>variance</em>, the “spread” of random values, is huge for small&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(\delta p\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let’s try a different approach. It is natural to think of <span class="math inline">\(X(p)\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> as forming a <em>family</em> of random variables, all defined on the same <em>probability space</em>. A probability space, with some simplification, is a sample space <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>, with a probability distribution <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}\)</span> defined on the sample space. From this point of view, each <span class="math inline">\(X(p)\)</span> can be expressed as a function <span class="math inline">\(\Omega \to \mathbb{R}\)</span>. To sample from a particular <span class="math inline">\(X(p)\)</span>, we can imagine drawing a random <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> according to <span class="math inline">\(\PP\)</span>, and then plugging this into <span class="math inline">\(X(p)\)</span>, i.e.&nbsp;computing <span class="math inline">\(X(p)(\omega)\)</span>. (Computationally, this is how most distributions are actually implemented: you start with a primitive pseudo-random number generator for a very simple distribution,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> e.g.&nbsp;drawing values <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> uniformly from <span class="math inline">\(\Omega = [0,1)\)</span>, and then you build other distributions on top of this by transforming <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> somehow.) Intuitively, all of the “randomness” resides in the probability space, and crucially <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}\)</span> does not depend on <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>: as <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> varies, <span class="math inline">\(X(p)\)</span> just becomes a different <em>deterministic</em> map on <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>.</p>
<p>The crux here is that all the <span class="math inline">\(X(p)\)</span> functions now depend on a shared source of randomness: the random draw of <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>. This means that <span class="math inline">\(X(p)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X(p+\delta p)\)</span> have a nontrivial joint distribution: what does it look like?</p>
<p>For concreteness, let’s study our exponential random variable <span class="math inline">\(X(p) \sim \operatorname{Exp}(p)\)</span> from above. Using the “inversion sampling” parameterization, it is possible to choose <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> to be <span class="math inline">\([0,1)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}\)</span> to be the uniform distribution over <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>; for any distribution, we can construct <span class="math inline">\(X(p)\)</span> to be a corresponding nondecreasing function over <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> (given by the inverse of <span class="math inline">\(X(p)\)</span>’s cumulative probability distribution). Applied to <span class="math inline">\(X(p) \sim \operatorname{Exp}(p)\)</span>, the inversion method gives <span class="math inline">\(X(p)(\omega) = -p \log{(1-\omega)}\)</span>. This is implemented below, and is a theoretically equivalent way of sampling <span class="math inline">\(X(p)\)</span> compared with the opaque <code>rand(Exponential(p))</code> function we used above:</p>

<p>As shown in Figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig:exp" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:exp">8</a>, we can plot <span class="math inline">\(X(p)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X(p+\delta p)\)</span> as functions over <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>. To sample the two of them jointly, we use the <em>same</em> choice of <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>: thus, <span class="math inline">\(\delta X(p)\)</span> can be formed by subtracting the two functions <em>pointwise</em> at each <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>. Ultimately, <span class="math inline">\(\delta X(p)\)</span> is itself a random variable over the same probability space, sampled in the same way: we pick a random <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> according to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}\)</span>, and evaluate <span class="math inline">\(\delta X(p)(\omega)\)</span>, using the function <span class="math inline">\(\delta X(p)\)</span> depicted above. Our first approach with independent samples is depicted in red in Figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig:exp" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:exp">8</a>, while our second approach is in blue. We can now see the flaw of the independent-samples approach: the <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}(1)\)</span>-sized “noise” from the independent samples washes out the <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}(\delta p)\)</span>-sized “signal”.</p>
<p>What about our second question (Question <a href="#question:neglect" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="question:neglect">[question:neglect]</a>): how can actually take the limit of <span class="math inline">\(\delta p \to 0\)</span> and compute the derivative? The idea is to differentiate <span class="math inline">\(\delta X(p)\)</span> at each fixed sample <span class="math inline">\(\omega \in \Omega\)</span>. In probability theory terms, we take the limit of random variables <span class="math inline">\(\delta X(p) / \delta p\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\delta p \to 0\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[X'(p) = \lim_{\delta p \to 0} \frac{\delta X(p)}{\delta p}.\]</span> For <span class="math inline">\(X(p) \sim \operatorname{Exp}(p)\)</span> parameterized via the inversion method, we get: <span class="math display">\[X'(p)(\omega) = \lim_{\delta p \to 0} \frac{-\delta p\log{(1-\omega)}}{\delta p} = -\log{(1-\omega)}.\]</span> Once again, <span class="math inline">\(X'(p)\)</span> is a random variable over the same probability space. The claim is that <span class="math inline">\(X'(p)\)</span> is the notion of derivative we were looking for! Indeed, <span class="math inline">\(X'(p)\)</span> is itself in fact a valid gradient estimator: <span class="math display">\[\EE[X'(p)] = \EE\left[ \lim_{\delta p \to 0} \frac{\delta X(p)}{\delta p}\right] \stackrel{?}{=}
\lim_{\delta p \to 0} \frac{\EE[\delta X(p)]}{\delta p} =
    \frac{\partial \EE[X(p)]}{\partial p}.
    \label{eq:exchange}\]</span> Rigorously, one needs to justify the interchange of limit and expectation in the above. In this chapter, however, we will be content with a crude empirical justification:</p>

<p>Using the “reparameterization trick” to form a gradient estimator, as we have done here, is a fairly old idea. It is also called the “pathwise” gradient estimator. Recently, it has become very popular in machine learning due to its use in VAEs [e.g.&nbsp;Kingma&nbsp;&amp; Welling (2013): <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114" class="uri">https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114</a>], and lots of resources can be found online on it. Since composition simply works by the usual chain rule, it also works in reverse mode, and can differentiate functions far more complicated than the one above!</p>

<p>The parameterization of a Bernoulli variable is shown in Figure 2. Using the inversion method once again, the parameterization of a Bernoulli variable looks like a step function: for <span class="math inline">\(\omega &lt; 1-p\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(X(p)(\omega) = 0\)</span>, while for <span class="math inline">\(\omega \geq 1-p\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(X(p)(\omega) = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, what happens when we perturb <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>? Let’s imagine perturbing <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> by a positive amount <span class="math inline">\(\delta p\)</span>. As shown in Figure 2, something qualitatively very different has happened here. At nearly every <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> except a small region of probability <span class="math inline">\(\delta p\)</span>, the output does not change. Thus, the quantity <span class="math inline">\(X'(p)\)</span> we defined in the previous subsection (which, strictly speaking, was defined by an "almost-sure" limit that neglects regions of probability 0) is 0 at every <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>: after all, for every <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>, there exists small enough <span class="math inline">\(\delta p\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\delta X(p)(\omega) = 0\)</span>.</p>

<p>However, there is certainly an important derivative contribution to consider here. The expectation of a Bernoulli is <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, so we would expect the derivative to be 1: but <span class="math inline">\(\EE[X'(p)] = \EE[0] = 0\)</span>. What has gone wrong is that, although <span class="math inline">\(\delta X(p)\)</span> is 0 with tiny probability, the value of <span class="math inline">\(\delta X(p)\)</span> on this region of tiny probability is 1, which is <em>large</em>. In particular, it does not approach 0 as <span class="math inline">\(\delta p\)</span> approaches 0. Thus, to develop a notion of derivative of <span class="math inline">\(X(p)\)</span>, we need to somehow capture these large jumps with “infinitesimal” probability.</p>
<p>A recent (2022) publication (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08572" class="uri">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08572</a>) by the author of this chapter (Gaurav Arya), together with Frank&nbsp;Schäfer, Moritz&nbsp;Schauer, and Chris&nbsp;Rackauckas, worked to extend the above ideas to develop a notion of “stochastic derivative” for discrete randomness, implemented by a software package called <code>StochasticAD.jl</code> that performs automatic differentiation of such stochastic processes. It generalizes the idea of dual numbers to stochastic <em>triples</em>, which include a third component to capture exactly these large jumps. For example, the stochastic triple of a Bernoulli variable might look like:</p>
<pre class="jlcon"><code>julia&gt; using StochasticAD, Distributions
julia&gt; f(p) = rand(Bernoulli(p)) # 1 with probability p, 0 otherwise
julia&gt; stochastic_triple(f, 0.5) # Feeds 0.5 + δp into f
StochasticTriple of Int64:
0 + 0ε + (1 with probability 2.0ε)</code></pre>
<p>Here, <span class="math inline">\(\delta p\)</span> is denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\upepsilon\)</span>, imagined to be an “infinitesimal unit”, so that the above triple indicates a flip from 0 to 1 with probability that has derivative <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>.</p>
<p>However, many aspects of these problems are still difficult, and there are a lot of improvements awaiting future developments! If you’re interested in reading more, you may be interested in the paper and our package linked above, as well as the 2020 review article by Mohamed <em>et&nbsp;al.</em> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10652" class="uri">https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10652</a>), which is a great survey of the field of gradient estimation in general.</p>
<p>At the end of class, we considered a differentiable random walk example with <code>StochasticAD.jl</code>. Here it is!</p>

<h1>Second Derivatives, Bilinear Maps, and Hessian Matrices</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we apply the principles of this course to <em>second</em> derivatives, which are conceptually just derivatives of derivatives but turn out to have many interesting ramifications. We begin with a (probably) familiar case of scalar-valued functions from multi-variable calculus, in which the second derivative is simply a matrix called the <em>Hessian</em>. Subsequently, however, we will show that similar principles can be applied to more complicated input and output spaces, generalizing to a notion of <span class="math inline">\(f''\)</span> as a <em>symmetric bilinear map</em>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec:Hessian-scalar">Hessian matrices of scalar-valued functions</h2>
<p>Recall that for a function <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \in \mathbb{R}\)</span> that maps column vectors <span class="math inline">\(x \in \mathbb{R}^n\)</span> to scalars (<span class="math inline">\(f: \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto \mathbb{R}\)</span>), the first derivative <span class="math inline">\(f'\)</span> can be expressed in terms of the familiar gradient <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f = (f')^T\)</span> of multivariable calculus: <span class="math display">\[\nabla f = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} \\ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2} \\ \vdots \\ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n}
\end{pmatrix} \, .\]</span> If we think of <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span> as a new (generally nonlinear) function mapping <span class="math inline">\(x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto \nabla f \in \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>, then its derivative is an <span class="math inline">\(n \times n\)</span> Jacobian matrix (a linear operator mapping vectors to vectors), which we can write down explicitly in terms of <em>second</em> derivatives of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[(\nabla f)' =
\begin{pmatrix}
   \frac{\partial^2 f}{ \partial x_1^2} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_n \partial x_1} \\
        \vdots  &amp;\ddots &amp; \vdots \\
        \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_1 \partial x_n} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_n \partial x_n}
    \end{pmatrix} = H \, .\]</span> This matrix, denoted here by <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>, is known as the <strong>Hessian</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, which has entries: <span class="math display">\[H_{i,j} = \frac{\partial^2 f}{ \partial x_j \partial x_i} = \frac{\partial^2 f}{ \partial x_i \partial x_j} = H_{j,i}  \, .\]</span> The fact that you can take partial derivatives in either order is a familiar fact from multivariable calculus (sometimes called the “symmetry of mixed derivatives” or “equality of mixed partials”), and means that the Hessian is a <em>symmetric matrix</em> <span class="math inline">\(H = H^T\)</span>. (We will later see that such symmetries arise very generally from the construction of second derivatives.)</p>
<div class="example">
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(x \in \mathbb{R}^2\)</span> and the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = \sin(x_1) + x_1^2 x_2^3\)</span>, its gradient is <span class="math display">\[\nabla f = \begin{pmatrix} \cos(x_1) + 2x_1 x_2^3 \\
3 x_1^2 x_2^2
\end{pmatrix} \, ,\]</span> and its Hessian is <span class="math display">\[H = (\nabla f)' = \begin{pmatrix} -\sin(x_1) + 2x_2^3 &amp; 6 x_1 x_2^2 \\
6 x_1 x_2^2 &amp; 6 x_1^2 x_2 \end{pmatrix} = H^T \, .\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>If we think of the Hessian as the Jacobian of <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span>, this tells us that <span class="math inline">\(H \, dx\)</span> predicts the change in <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span> to first order: <span class="math display">\[d(\nabla f) = \left. \nabla f \right|_{x+dx} - \left. \nabla f \right|_{x} = H \, dx \, .\]</span> Note that <span class="math inline">\(\left. \nabla f \right|_{x+dx}\)</span> means <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span> evaluated at <span class="math inline">\(x+dx\)</span>, which is very different from <span class="math inline">\(df = (\nabla f)^T dx\)</span>, where we act <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)=(\nabla f)^T\)</span> <em>on</em> <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span>.</p>
<p>Instead of thinking of <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> of predicting the <em>first</em>-order change in <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span>, however, we can also think of it as predicting the <em>second</em>-order change in <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, a <strong>quadratic approximation</strong> (which could be viewed as the first three terms in a multidimensional Taylor series): <span class="math display">\[f(x+\delta x) = f(x) + (\nabla f)^T \, \delta x + \frac{1}{2} \delta x^T \, H \, \delta x + o(\Vert \delta x \Vert^2) \, ,\]</span> where both <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> are evaluated at <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, and we have switched from an infinitesimal <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> to a finite change <span class="math inline">\(\delta x\)</span> so that we emphasize the viewpoint of an <em>approximation</em> where terms higher than second-order in <span class="math inline">\(\Vert \delta x \Vert\)</span> are dropped. You can derive this in a variety of ways, e.g.&nbsp;by taking the derivative of both sides with respect to <span class="math inline">\(\delta x\)</span> to reproduce <span class="math inline">\(\left. \nabla f \right|_{x+\delta x} = \left. \nabla f \right|_{x} + H \, \delta x + o(\delta x)\)</span>: a quadratic approximation for <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> corresponds to a linear approximation for <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span>. Related to this equation, another useful (and arguably more fundamental) relation that we can derive (and <em>will</em> derive much more generally below) is: <span class="math display">\[dx^T H dx' = f(x + dx + dx') + f(x) - f(x + dx) - f(x + dx') = f''(x)[dx,dx'] \,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(dx'\)</span> are two independent “infinitesimal” directions and we have dropped terms of higher than second order. This formula is very suggestive, because it uses <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> to map <em>two</em> vectors into a <em>scalar</em>, which we will generalize below into the idea of a <strong>bilinear map</strong> <span class="math inline">\(f''(x)[dx,dx']\)</span>. This formula is also obviously symmetric with respect to interchange of <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(dx'\)</span> — <span class="math inline">\(f''(x)[dx,dx'] = f''(x)[dx',dx]\)</span> — which will lead us once again to the symmetry <span class="math inline">\(H=H^T\)</span> below.</p>
<div class="proof remark">
<p><span class="proof-title"><em>Remark</em>. </span>Consider the Hessian matrix versus other Jacobian matrices.

<section id="general-second-derivatives-bilinear-maps" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="general-second-derivatives-bilinear-maps">General second derivatives: Bilinear maps</h2>
<p>Recall, as we have been doing throughout this class, that we define the derivative of a function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> by a linearization of its change <span class="math inline">\(df\)</span> for a small (“infinitesimal”) change <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> in the input: <span class="math display">\[df = f(x + dx) - f(x) = f'(x) [dx] \, ,\]</span> implicitly dropping higher-order terms. If we similarly consider the second derivative <span class="math inline">\(f''\)</span> as simply the same process applied to <span class="math inline">\(f'\)</span> instead of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, we obtain the following formula, which is easy to write down but will take some thought to interpret: <span class="math display">\[d f' = f'(x + dx') - f'(x) = f''(x) [dx'].\]</span> (Notation: <span class="math inline">\(dx'\)</span> is not some kind of derivative of <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span>; the prime simply denotes a <em>different</em> arbitrary small change in&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.) What kind of “thing” is <span class="math inline">\(df'\)</span>? Let’s consider a simple concrete example:</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider the following function <span class="math inline">\(f(x): \mathbb{R}^2 \mapsto \mathbb{R}^2\)</span> mapping two-component vectors <span class="math inline">\(x \in \mathbb{R}^2\)</span> to two-component vectors <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \in \mathbb{R}^2\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[f(x) = \begin{pmatrix} x_1^2 \sin(x_2) \\ 5x_1 - x_2^3
\end{pmatrix} \, .\]</span> Its first derivative is described by a <span class="math inline">\(2\times 2\)</span> Jacobian matrix: <span class="math display">\[f'(x) = \begin{pmatrix}
2x_1 \sin(x_2) &amp; x_1^2 \cos(x_2) \\
5 &amp; -3x_2^2
\end{pmatrix}\]</span> that maps a small change <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> in the input vector <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to the corresponding small change <span class="math inline">\(df = f'(x)dx\)</span> in the output vector <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>.</p>
<p>What is <span class="math inline">\(df' = f''(x)[dx']\)</span>? It must take a small change <span class="math inline">\(dx' = (dx_1', dx_2')\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and return the first-order change <span class="math inline">\(df' = f'(x+dx')-f'(x)\)</span> in our Jacobian matrix <span class="math inline">\(f'\)</span>. If we simply take the differential of each entry of our Jacobian (a function from vectors <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to matrices <span class="math inline">\(f'\)</span>), we find: <span class="math display">\[df' =
\begin{pmatrix}
2\,dx_1' \sin(x_2) + 2x_1 \cos(x_2) \,dx_2' &amp; 2 x_1 \, dx_1' \cos(x_2) - x_1^2 \sin(x_2)\, dx_2' \\
0 &amp; -6x_2\,dx_2'
\end{pmatrix}
= f''(x)[dx']\]</span> That is, <span class="math inline">\(df'\)</span> is a <span class="math inline">\(2\times 2\)</span> matrix of “infinitesimal” entries, of the same shape as <span class="math inline">\(f'\)</span>.</p>
<p>From this viewpoint, <span class="math inline">\(f''(x)\)</span> is a linear operator acting on vectors <span class="math inline">\(dx'\)</span> and outputting <span class="math inline">\(2\times 2\)</span> matrices <span class="math inline">\(f''(x)[dx']\)</span>, but this is one of the many cases where it is easier to write down the linear operator as a “rule” than as a “thing” like a matrix. The “thing” would have to either be some kind of “three-dimensional matrix” or we would have to “vectorize” <span class="math inline">\(f'\)</span> into a “column vector” of 4 entries in order to write its <span class="math inline">\(4\times 4\)</span> Jacobian, as in Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:kronecker" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:kronecker">3</a> (which can obscure the underlying structure of the problem).</p>
<p>Furthermore, since this <span class="math inline">\(df'\)</span> is a linear operator (a matrix), we can act it on <em>another</em> vector <span class="math inline">\(dx = (dx_1, dx_2)\)</span> to obtain: <span class="math display">\[df' \begin{pmatrix} dx_1 \\ dx_2 \end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}
2 \sin(x_2) \,dx_1'\,dx_1 + 2x_1 \cos(x_2) (\,dx_2'\,dx_1 + \, dx_1' \, dx_2) - x_1^2 \sin(x_2)\, dx_2' \, dx_2 \\
-6x_2\,dx_2' \,dx_2
\end{pmatrix} = f''(x)[dx'][dx] \, .\]</span> Notice that <em>this</em> result, which we will call <span class="math inline">\(f''(x)[dx', dx]\)</span> below, is the “same shape” as <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> (a 2-component vector). Moreover, it doesn’t change if we swap <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(dx'\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(f''(x)[dx', dx] = f''(x)[dx, dx']\)</span>, a key symmetry of the second derivative that we will discuss further below.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="math inline">\(df'\)</span> is an (infinitesimal) object of the same “shape” as <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)\)</span>, <em>not</em> <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>. Here, <span class="math inline">\(f'\)</span> is a linear operator, so its change <span class="math inline">\(df'\)</span> must <em>also</em> be an (infinitesimal) linear operator (a “small change” in a linear operator) that we can therefore act on an arbitrary <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> (or <span class="math inline">\(\delta x\)</span>), in the form: <span class="math display">\[df'[dx] = f''(x) [dx'][dx] := f''(x) [dx', dx] \, ,\]</span> where we combine the two brackets for brevity. This final result <span class="math inline">\(f''(x) [dx', dx]\)</span> is the same type of object (vector) as the original output <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>. This implies that <span class="math inline">\(f''(x)\)</span> is a <em>bilinear map</em>: acting on <strong>two</strong> vectors, and linear in either vector taken individually. (We will see shortly that the ordering of <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(dx'\)</span> doesn’t matter: <span class="math inline">\(f''(x)[dx',dx]=f''(x)[dx,dx']\)</span>.)</p>
<p>More precisely, we have the following.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(U,V,W\)</span> be a vector spaces, not necessarily the same. Then, a <strong>bilinear map</strong> is a function <span class="math inline">\(B:U\times V \to W\)</span>, mapping a <span class="math inline">\(u \in U\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v \in V\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(B[u,v] \in W\)</span>, such that we have linearity in both arguments: <span class="math display">\[\begin{cases}
        B[u, \alpha v_1 + \beta v_2] = \alpha B[u,v_1] + \beta B[u,v_2] \\
        B[\alpha u_1 + \beta u_2, v] = \alpha B[u_1,v] + \beta B[u_2,v]
    \end{cases}\]</span> for any scalars <span class="math inline">\(\alpha, \beta\)</span>,</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(W = \mathbb{R}\)</span>, i.e.&nbsp;the output is a scalar, then it is called a <strong>bilinear form</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p>Note that in general, even if <span class="math inline">\(U = V\)</span> (the two inputs <span class="math inline">\(u,v\)</span> are the “same type” of vector) we may have <span class="math inline">\(B[u,v] \neq B[v,u]\)</span>, but in the case of <span class="math inline">\(f''\)</span> we have something very special that happens. In particular, we can show that <span class="math inline">\(f''(x)\)</span> is a <em>symmetric bilinear map</em>, meaning <span class="math display">\[f''(x) [dx', dx] = f''(x) [dx, dx']\]</span> for any <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(dx'\)</span>. Why? Because, applying the definition of <span class="math inline">\(f''\)</span> as giving the change in <span class="math inline">\(f'\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(dx'\)</span>, and then the definition of <span class="math inline">\(f'\)</span> as giving the change in <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span>, we can re-order terms to obtain: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    f''(x) [dx', dx] &amp;= f'(x +
    dx') [dx] - f'(x) [dx] \\
    &amp;= \left(f(x+ \underbrace{dx' + dx}_{= dx + dx'}) - f(x+ dx')\right) - \left(f(x+ dx) - f(x)\right) \\
    &amp;= \boxed{f(x + dx + dx') + f(x) - f(x + dx) - f(x + dx')} \\
    &amp;= \left(f(x + dx + dx')  - f(x + dx)\right) - \left(f(x + dx') - f(x)\right) \\
    &amp;= f'(x +
    dx) [dx'] - f'(x) [dx'] \\
    &amp;= f''(x) [dx, dx'] \,
\end{aligned}\]</span> where we’ve boxed the middle formula for <span class="math inline">\(f''\)</span> which emphasizes its symmetry in a natural way. (The basic reason why this works is that the “<span class="math inline">\(+\)</span>” operation is always <em>commutative</em> for any vector space. A geometric interpretation is depicted in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:second-deriv" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:second-deriv">12</a>.)</p>

</div>
<p>Recall that <span class="math display">\[f'(x) = (\nabla f)^T \implies f'(x) [dx] = \text{scalar } df = (\nabla f)^T dx.\]</span> Similarly, <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}

<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = x^T A x\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(x \in \R^n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> an <span class="math inline">\(n \times n\)</span> matrix. As above, <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \in \R\)</span> (scalar outputs). Compute <span class="math inline">\(f''\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>The computation is fairly straightforward. Firstly, we have that <span class="math display">\[f' = (\nabla f)^T = x^T(A + A^T).\]</span> This implies that <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f = (A + A^T) x\)</span>, a linear function of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Hence, the Jacobian of <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span> is the Hessian <span class="math inline">\(f'' = H = A + A^T\)</span>. Furthermore, note that this implies <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    f(x) &amp;= x^T A x = (x^T A x)^T  \qquad (\mathrm{scalar} = \mathrm{scalar}^T)\\
    &amp;= x^T A^T x \\
    &amp;= \frac{1}{2} (x^T A x + x^T A^T x) = \frac{1}{2} x^T (A + A^T) x\\
    &amp;= \frac{1}{2} x^T H x = \frac{1}{2} f''[x,x] \, ,
\end{aligned}\]</span> which will turn out to be a special case of the quadratic approximations of Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:Hessian-quadratic" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:Hessian-quadratic">12.3</a> (exact in this example since <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=x^T A x\)</span> is quadratic to start with).</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(f(A) = \det A\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> an <span class="math inline">\(n\times n\)</span> matrix. Express <span class="math inline">\(f''(A)\)</span> as a rule for <span class="math inline">\(f''(A)[dA,dA']\)</span> in terms of <span class="math inline">\(dA\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(dA'\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>From lecture 3, we have the first derivative <span class="math display">\[f'(A) [dA] = df = \det (A) \tr(A^{-1} dA).\]</span> Now, we want to compute the change <span class="math inline">\(d'(df) = d'(f'(A)[dA]) = f'(A+dA')[dA] - f'(A)[dA]\)</span> in this formula, i.e.&nbsp;the differential (denoted <span class="math inline">\(d'\)</span>) where we change <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(dA'\)</span> while treating <span class="math inline">\(dA\)</span> as a constant: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    f''(A) [dA, dA'] &amp;= d' (\det A \tr (A^{-1} dA)) \\
    &amp;= \det A \tr(A^{-1} dA') \tr(A^{-1} dA) - \det A \tr(A^{-1} \,dA' A^{-1}\, dA) \\
    &amp;= f''(A) [dA', dA]
\end{aligned}\]</span> where the last line (symmetry) can be derived explicitly by the cyclic property of the trace (although of course it must be true for any <span class="math inline">\(f''\)</span>). Although <span class="math inline">\(f''\)</span> here is a perfectly good bilinear form acting on matrices <span class="math inline">\(dA,dA'\)</span>, it is not very natural to express <span class="math inline">\(f''\)</span> as a “Hessian matrix.”</p>
<p>If we really wanted to express <span class="math inline">\(f''\)</span> in terms of an explicit Hessian matrix, we could use the the “vectorization” approach of Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:kronecker" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:kronecker">3</a>. Let us consider, for example, the term <span class="math inline">\(\tr(A^{-1} \,dA' A^{-1}\, dA)\)</span> using Kronecker products (Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:kronecker" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:kronecker">3</a>). In general, for matrices <span class="math inline">\(X,Y,B,C\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[(\operatorname{vec}{X})^T (B \otimes C) \operatorname{vec}{Y} = (\operatorname{vec}{X})^T \operatorname{vec}{(CYB^T)} = \tr(X^T CYB^T) = \tr(B^T X^T CY) \, ,\]</span> recalling that <span class="math inline">\((\operatorname{vec}{X})^T \operatorname{vec}{Y} = \tr(X^T Y)\)</span> is the Frobenius inner product (Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:generalvectorspaces" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:generalvectorspaces">5</a>). Thus, <span class="math display">\[\tr(A^{-1} \,dA' A^{-1}\, dA)
= \operatorname{vec}{(dA'^T)}^T (A^{-T} \otimes A^{-1}) \operatorname{vec}{(dA)} \, .\]</span> This is still not quite in the form we want for a Hessian matrix, however, because it involves <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{vec}{(dA'^T)}\)</span> rather than <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{vec}{(dA')}\)</span> (the two vectors are related by a permutation matrix, sometimes called a “commutation” matrix). Completing this calculation would be a nice exercise in mastery of Kronecker products, but getting an explicit Hessian seems like a lot of algebra for a result of dubious utility!</p>

<p>So how do we ultimately think about <span class="math inline">\(f''\)</span>? We know that <span class="math inline">\(f'\)</span> is the linearization/linear approximation of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math display">\[f(x + \delta x ) = f(x) + f'(x) [\delta x] + o(\lVert \delta x\rVert).\]</span> Now, just as we did for the simple case of Hessian matrices in Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:Hessian-scalar" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:Hessian-scalar">12.1</a> above, we can use <span class="math inline">\(f''\)</span> to form a <em>quadratic approximation</em> of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>. In particular, one can show that <span class="math display">\[f(x+ \delta x) = f(x) + f'(x) [\delta x] + \frac{1}{2} f''(x) [\delta x, \delta x] +  o (\lVert \delta x\rVert^2).\]</span> Note that the <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> factor is just as in the Taylor series. To derive this, simply plug the quadratic approximation into <span class="math display">\[f''(x) [dx, dx'] = f(x + dx + dx') + f(x) - f(x + dx) - f(x + dx').\]</span> and check that the right-hand side reproduces <span class="math inline">\(f''(x)\)</span>. (Note how <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(dx'\)</span> appear symmetrically in this formula, which reflects the symmetry of <span class="math inline">\(f''\)</span>.)</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hessians-and-optimization">Hessians and optimization</h2>
<p>Many important applications of second derivatives, Hessians, and quadratic approximations arise in optimization: minimization (or maximization) of functions <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<section id="newton-like-methods" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="newton-like-methods">Newton-like methods</h3>
<p>When searching for a local minimum (or maximum) of a complicated function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>, a common procedure is to approximate <span class="math inline">\(f(x+\delta x)\)</span> by a simpler “model” function for small <span class="math inline">\(\delta x\)</span>, and then to optimize this model to obtain a potential optimization step. For example, approximating <span class="math inline">\(f(x+\delta x) \approx f(x)+f'(x)[\delta x]\)</span> (an affine model, colloquially called “linear”) leads to gradient descent and related algorithms. A better approximation for <span class="math inline">\(f(x + \delta x)\)</span> will often lead to faster-converging algorithms, and so a natural idea is to exploit the <em>second</em> derivative <span class="math inline">\(f''\)</span> to make a quadratic model, as above, and accelerate optimization.</p>
<p>For unconstrained optimization, minimizing <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> corresponds to finding a root of the derivative <span class="math inline">\(f' = 0\)</span> (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f = 0\)</span>), and a <em>quadratic</em> approximation for <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> yields a first-order (affine) approximation <span class="math inline">\(f'(x + \delta x) \approx f'(x) + f''(x)[\delta x]\)</span> for the derivative <span class="math inline">\(f'\)</span>. In <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>, this is <span class="math inline">\(\delta(\nabla f) \approx H \delta x\)</span>. So, minimizing a quadratic model is effectively a <em>Newton step</em> <span class="math inline">\(\delta x \approx -H^{-1} \nabla f\)</span> to find a root of <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span> via first-order approximation. Thus, optimization via quadratic approximations is often viewed as a form of Newton algorithm. As discussed below, it is also common to employ <em>approximate</em> Hessians in optimization, resulting in “quasi-Newton” algorithms.</p>
<p>More complicated versions of this idea arise in optimization with constraints, e.g.&nbsp;minimizing an objective function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> subject to one or more nonlinear inequality constraints <span class="math inline">\(c_k(x) \le 0\)</span>. In such cases, there are a variety of methods that take both first and second derivatives into account, such as “sequential quadratic programming”<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> (SQP) algorithms that solve a sequence of “QP” approximations involving quadratic objectives with affine constraints (see e.g.&nbsp;the book <em>Numerical Optimization</em> by Nocedal and Wright, 2006).</p>
<p>There are many technical details, beyond the scope of this course, that must be resolved in order to translate such high-level ideas into practical algorithms. For example, a quadratic model is only valid for small enough <span class="math inline">\(\delta x\)</span>, so there must be some mechanism to limit the step size. One possibility is “backtracking line search”: take a Newton step <span class="math inline">\(x+\delta x\)</span> and, if needed, progressively “backtrack” to <span class="math inline">\(x+\delta x/10, x+\delta x/100, \ldots\)</span> until a sufficiently decreased value of the objective is found. Another commonplace idea is a “trust region”: optimize the model with the constraint that <span class="math inline">\(\delta x\)</span> is sufficiently small, e.g.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(\Vert \delta x \Vert \le s\)</span> (a spherical trust region), along with some rules to adaptively enlarge or shrink the trust-region size (<span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>) depending on how well the model predicts <span class="math inline">\(\delta f\)</span>. There are many variants of Newton/SQP-like algorithms depending on the choices made for these and other details.</p>

<section id="computing-hessians" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="computing-hessians">Computing Hessians</h3>
<p>In general, finding <span class="math inline">\(f''\)</span> or the Hessian is often computationally expensive in higher dimensions. If <span class="math inline">\(f(x): \R^n\to\R\)</span>, then the Hessian, <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>, is an <span class="math inline">\(n\times n\)</span> matrix, which can be huge if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is large—even storing <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> may be prohibitive, much less computing it. When using automatic differentiation (AD), Hessians are often computed by a <em>combination</em> of forward and reverse modes (Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:forward-over-reverse" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:forward-over-reverse">8.4.1</a>), but AD does not circumvent the fundamental scaling difficulty for large&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p>Instead of computing <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> explicitly, however, one can instead <em>approximate</em> the Hessian in various ways; in the context of optimization, approximate Hessians are found in “quasi-Newton” methods such as the famous “BFGS” algorithm and its variants. One can also derive efficient methods to compute Hessian–vector products <span class="math inline">\(Hv\)</span> without computing <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> explicitly, e.g.&nbsp;for use in Newton–Krylov methods. (Such a product <span class="math inline">\(Hv\)</span> is equivalent to a directional derivative of <span class="math inline">\(f'\)</span>, which is efficiently computed by “forward-over-reverse” AD as in Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:forward-over-reverse" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:forward-over-reverse">8.4.1</a>.)</p>

<section id="minima-maxima-and-saddle-points" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="minima-maxima-and-saddle-points">Minima, maxima, and saddle points</h3>
<p>Generalizing the rules you may recall from single- and multi-variable calculus, we can use the second derivative to determine whether an extremum is a minimum, maximum, or saddle point. Firstly, an extremum of a scalar function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a point <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(f'(x_0) = 0\)</span>. That is, <span class="math display">\[f'(x_0) [\delta x] = 0\]</span> for <em>any</em> <span class="math inline">\(\delta x\)</span>. Equivalently, <span class="math display">\[\nabla f \bigr|_{x_0} = f'(x_0)^T = 0.\]</span></p>
<p>Using our quadratic approximation around <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span>, we then have that <span class="math display">\[f(x_0 + \delta x) = f(x_0) + \underbrace{f'(x_0) [\delta x]}_{=0} + \frac{1}{2} f''(x_0) [\delta x, \delta x] + o(\lVert \delta x\rVert^2).\]</span> The definition of a local minimum <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> is that <span class="math inline">\(f(x_0 + \delta x ) &gt; f(x_0)\)</span> for any <span class="math inline">\(\delta x \neq 0\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\lVert \delta x\rVert\)</span> sufficiently small. To achieve this at a point where <span class="math inline">\(f' = 0\)</span>, it is enough to have <span class="math inline">\(f''\)</span> be a positive-definite quadratic form: <span class="math display">\[f''(x_0) [\delta x, \delta x] &gt;0 \text{ for all } \delta x \ne 0 \iff \textbf{positive-definite } f''(x_0) \, .\]</span></p>
<p>For example, for inputs <span class="math inline">\(x\in \R^n\)</span>, so that <span class="math inline">\(f''\)</span> is a real-symmetric <span class="math inline">\(n \times n\)</span> Hessian matrix, <span class="math inline">\(f''(x_0) = H(x_0) = H(x_0)^T\)</span>, this corresponds to the usual criteria for a positive-definite matrix: <span class="math display">\[f''(x_0) [\delta x, \delta x] = \delta x^T H(x_0) \delta x &gt;0 \text{ for all } \delta x \ne 0 \iff H(x_0) \text{ positive-definite } \iff \text{all eigenvalues of } H(x_0) &gt; 0.\]</span></p>
<p>In first-year calculus, one often focuses in particular on the 2-dimensional case, where <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is a <span class="math inline">\(2\times 2\)</span> matrix. In the <span class="math inline">\(2\times 2\)</span> case, there is a simple way to check the signs of the two eigenvalues of <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>, in order to check whether an extremum is a minimum or maximum: the eigenvalues are both positive if and only if <span class="math inline">\(\det (H) &gt;0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tr(H)  &gt;0\)</span>, since <span class="math inline">\(\det (H) = \lambda_1 \lambda_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tr(H) = \lambda_1 + \lambda_2\)</span>. In higher dimensions, however, one needs more complicated techniques to compute eigenvalues and/or check positive-definiteness, e.g.&nbsp;as discussed in MIT courses 18.06 (Linear Algebra) and/or 18.335 (Introduction to Numerical Methods). (In practice, one typically checks positive-definiteness by performing a form of Gaussian elimination, called a Cholesky factorization, and checking that the diagonal “pivot” elements are <span class="math inline">\(&gt; 0\)</span>, rather than by computing eigenvalues which are much more expensive.)</p>
<p>Similarly, a point <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f = 0\)</span> is a local <em>maximum</em> if <span class="math inline">\(f''\)</span> is negative-definite, or equivalently if the eigenvalues of the Hessian are all negative. Additionally, <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> is a <em>saddle</em> point if <span class="math inline">\(f''\)</span> is indefinite, i.e.&nbsp;the eigenvalues include both positive and negative values. However, cases where some eigenvalues are zero are more complicated to analyze; e.g.&nbsp;if the eigenvalues are all <span class="math inline">\(\ge 0\)</span> but some are <span class="math inline">\(=0\)</span>, then whether the point is a minimum depends upon higher derivatives.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="further-reading-1">Further Reading</h2>
<p>All of this formalism about “bilinear forms” and so forth may seem like a foray into abstraction for the sake of abstraction. Can’t we always reduce things to ordinary matrices by choosing a basis (“vectorizing” our inputs and outputs)? However, we often don’t <em>want</em> to do this for the same reason that we often prefer to express first derivatives as linear operators rather than as explicit Jacobian matrices. Writing linear or bilinear operators as explicit matrices, e.g.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{vec}(A\,dA + dA\,A) = (I\otimes A + A^T \otimes I)\operatorname{vec}(dA)\)</span> as in Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:kronecker" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:kronecker">3</a>, often disguises the underlying structure of the operator and introduces a lot of algebraic complexity for no purpose, as well as being potentially computationally costly (e.g.&nbsp;exchanging small matrices <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> for large ones <span class="math inline">\(I \otimes A\)</span>).</p>
<p>As we discussed in this chapter, an important generalization of quadratic operations to arbitrary vector spaces come in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_map">bilinear maps</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_form">bilinear forms</a>, and there are many textbooks and other sources discussing these ideas and variations thereof. For example, we saw that the second derivative can be seen as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_bilinear_form">symmetric bilinear form</a>. This is closely related to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_form">quadratic form</a> <span class="math inline">\(Q[x]\)</span>, which what we get by plugging the same vector twice into a symmetric bilinear form <span class="math inline">\(B[x,y]=B[y,x]\)</span>, i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(Q[x] = B[x,x]\)</span>. (At first glance, it may seem like <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> carries “less information” than <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, but in fact this is not the case. It is easy to see that one can recover <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> via <span class="math inline">\(B[x,y] = (Q[x+y] - Q[x-y])/4\)</span>, called a “polarization identity.”) For example, the <span class="math inline">\(f''(x) [\delta x, \delta x]/2\)</span> term that appears in quadratic approximations of <span class="math inline">\(f(x+ \delta x)\)</span> is a quadratic form. The most familiar multivariate version of <span class="math inline">\(f''(x)\)</span> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hessian_matrix">Hessian matrix</a> when <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is a column vector and <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is a scalar, and Khan Academy has an elementary <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/applications-of-multivariable-derivatives/quadratic-approximations/a/quadratic-approximation">introduction to quadratic approximation</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definite_matrix">Positive-definite</a> Hessian matrices, or more generally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definite_quadratic_form">definite quadratic forms</a> <span class="math inline">\(f''\)</span>, appear at extrema (<span class="math inline">\(f' =0\)</span>) of scalar-valued functions <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> that are local minima. There are a lot <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~md3405/Unconstrained_Optimization.pdf">more formal treatments</a> of the same idea, and conversely Khan Academy has the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/applications-of-multivariable-derivatives/optimizing-multivariable-functions/a/second-partial-derivative-test">simple 2-variable version</a> where you can check the sign of the <span class="math inline">\(2\times 2\)</span> eignevalues just by looking at the determinant and a single entry (or the trace). There’s a nice <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2285282/relating-condition-number-of-hessian-to-the-rate-of-convergence">stackexchange discussion</a> on why an <a href="https://nhigham.com/2020/03/19/what-is-a-condition-number/">ill-conditioned</a> Hessian tends to make steepest descent converge slowly. Some Toronto <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse/courses/csc421_2019/slides/lec07.pdf">course notes on the topic</a> may also be useful.</p>
<p>Lastly, see for example these Stanford notes on <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee364b/lectures/seq_notes.pdf">sequential quadratic optimization</a> using trust regions (Section 2.2), as well as the 18.335 <a href="https://github.com/mitmath/18335/blob/spring21/notes/BFGS.pdf">notes on BFGS quasi-Newton methods</a>. The fact that a quadratic optimization problem in a sphere has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_duality">strong duality</a>, and hence is efficiently solvable, is discussed in Section 5.2.4 of the <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/"><em>Convex Optimization</em> book</a>. There has been a lot of work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hessian_automatic_differentiation">automatic Hessian computation</a>, but for large-scale problems you may only be able to compute Hessian–vector products efficiently in general, which are equivalent to a directional derivative of the gradient and can be used (for example) for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Krylov_method">Newton–Krylov methods</a>.</p>
<p>The Hessian matrix is also known as the “curvature matrix" especially in optimization. If we have a scalar function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> variables, its”graph” is the set of points <span class="math inline">\((x,f(x))\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(R^{n+1}\)</span>; we call the last dimension the “vertical" dimension. At a”critical point” <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (where <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f = 0\)</span>), then <span class="math inline">\(v^T H v\)</span> is the ordinary curvature sometimes taught in first-year calculus, of the curve obtained by intersecting the graph with the plane in the direction <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and the vertical (the “normal section”). The determinant of <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>, sometimes known as the Hessian determinant, yields the Gaussian curvature.</p>
<p>A closely related idea is the derivative of the unit normal. For a graph as in the preceding paragraph we may assume that <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=x^THx/2\)</span> to second order. It is easy to see that at any point <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> the tangents have the form <span class="math inline">\((dx, f'(x)[dx])=(dx,x^THdx)\)</span> and the normal is then <span class="math inline">\((Hx,1)\)</span>. Near <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span> this a unit normal to second order, and its derivative is <span class="math inline">\((Hdx,0)\)</span>. Projecting onto the horizontal, we see that the Hessian is the derivative of the unit normal. This is called the “shape operator" in differential geometry.</p>

<p>You may remember that the rank-1 matrix <span class="math inline">\(x x^T\)</span>, for any unit vector <span class="math inline">\(x^T x = 1\)</span>, is a <strong>projection matrix</strong> (meaning that it is equal to its square and it is symmetric) which projects vectors onto their components in the direction of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Correspondingly, <span class="math inline">\(I - x x^T\)</span> is also a projection matrix, but onto the directions <em>perpendicular</em> to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>: geometrically, the matrix removes components in the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> direction. In particular, if <span class="math inline">\(x^T dx= 0\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\((I - x x^T) dx = dx.\)</span> It follows that if <span class="math inline">\(x^T dx = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is a symmetric matrix, we have <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    d\left(\frac{1}{2} x^T A x\right) &amp;= (A x)^T dx \\
    &amp;= x^T A (dx) \\
    &amp;= x^T A ( I - x x^T) dx  \\
    &amp;= ((I - x x^T) A x )^T dx.
\end{aligned}\]</span> In other words, <span class="math inline">\((I - x x^T)A x\)</span> is the gradient of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2} x^T A x\)</span> <em>on the sphere.</em></p>
<p>So what did we just do? To obtain the gradient on the sphere, we needed (i) a linearization of the function that is correct on tangents, and (ii) a direction that <em>is</em> tangent (i.e.&nbsp;satisfies the linearized constraint). Using this, we obtain the gradient of a general scalar function on the sphere:</p>
<div class="theorem">
<p>Given <span class="math inline">\(f: \mathbb{S}^n \to \R\)</span>, we have <span class="math display">\[df = g(x)^T dx = (( I - x x^T) g(x))^T dx.\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>The proof of this is precisely the same as we did before for <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^T A x\)</span>.</p>

<section id="differentiating-on-orthogonal-matrices" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="differentiating-on-orthogonal-matrices">Differentiating on Orthogonal Matrices</h2>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> be an orthogonal matrix. Then, computationally (as is done in the Julia notebook), one can see that <span class="math inline">\(Q^T dQ\)</span> is an anti-symmetric matrix (sometimes called skew-symmetric).</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>A matrix <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is anti-symmetric if <span class="math inline">\(M = - M^T\)</span>. Note that all anti-symmetric matrices thus have zeroes on their diagonals.</p>
</div>
<p>In fact, we can prove that <span class="math inline">\(Q^T dQ\)</span> is anti-symmetric.</p>
<div class="theorem">
<p>Given <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is an orthogonal matrix, we have that <span class="math inline">\(Q^T dQ\)</span> is anti-symmetric.</p>
</div>
<div class="proof">
<p><span class="proof-title"><em>Proof</em>. </span><em>Proof.</em> The constraint of being orthogonal implies that <span class="math inline">\(Q^T Q = I\)</span>. Differentiating this equation, we obtain <span class="math display">\[Q^T dQ + dQ^T \, Q = 0 \implies Q^T dQ = - (Q^T dQ)^T.\]</span> This is precisely the definition of being anti-symmetric.&nbsp;◻</p>
</div>
<p>Before we move on, we may ask what the dimension of the “surface” of orthogonal matrices is in <span class="math inline">\(\R^{n^2}\)</span>.</p>
<p>When <span class="math inline">\(n = 2\)</span>, all orthogonal matrices are rotations and reflections, and rotations have the form <span class="math display">\[Q = \begin{pmatrix}
    \cos \theta &amp; \sin \theta \\
    - \sin \theta &amp; \cos \theta
\end{pmatrix}.\]</span> Hence, when <span class="math inline">\(n=2\)</span> we have one parameter.</p>
<p>When <span class="math inline">\(n = 3\)</span>, airplane pilots know about “roll, pitch, and yaw”, which are the three parameters for the orthogonal matrices when <span class="math inline">\(n =3.\)</span> In general, in <span class="math inline">\(\R^{n^2}\)</span>, the orthogonal group has dimension <span class="math inline">\(n(n-1)/2\)</span>.</p>
<p>There are a few ways to see this.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Firstly, orthogonality <span class="math inline">\(Q^T Q = I\)</span> imposes <span class="math inline">\(n(n+1)/2\)</span> constraints, leaving <span class="math inline">\(n(n-1)/2\)</span> free parameters.</p></li>
<li><p>When we do <span class="math inline">\(QR\)</span> decomposition, the <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> “eats” up <span class="math inline">\(n(n+1)/2\)</span> of the parameters, again leaving <span class="math inline">\(n(n-1)/2\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Lastly, If we think about the symmetric eigenvalue problem where <span class="math inline">\(S = Q \Lambda Q^T\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> has <span class="math inline">\(n(n+1) /2\)</span> parameters and <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> has <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> has <span class="math inline">\(n(n-1)/2\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="differentiating-the-symmetric-eigendecomposition" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="differentiating-the-symmetric-eigendecomposition">Differentiating the Symmetric Eigendecomposition</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> be a symmetric matrix, <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> be diagonal containing eigenvalues of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> be orthogonal with column vectors as eigenvectors of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(S = Q \Lambda Q^T\)</span>. [For simplicity, let’s assume that the eigenvalues are “simple” (multiplicity&nbsp;1); repeated eigenvalues turn out to greatly complicate the analysis of perturbations because of the ambiguity in their eigenvector basis.] Then, we have <span class="math display">\[dS = dQ \, \Lambda Q^T + Q \, d\Lambda \, Q^T + Q \Lambda dQ^T,\]</span> which may be written as <span class="math display">\[Q^T dS \, Q = Q^T dQ \Lambda - \Lambda Q^T dQ + d\Lambda.\]</span></p>
<p>As an exercise, one may check that the left and right hand sides of the above are both symmetric. This may be easier if one looks at the diagonal entries on their own, as there <span class="math inline">\((Q^T dS \, Q)_{ii} = q_i^T dS \, q_i\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(q_i\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th eigenvector, this implies <span class="math inline">\(q_i^T dS\, q_i = d\lambda_i.\)</span> (In physics, this is sometimes called the “Hellman–Feynman” theorem, or non-degenerate first-order eigenvalue-perturbation theory.)</p>
<p>Sometimes we think of a curve of matrices <span class="math inline">\(S(t)\)</span> depending on a parameter such as time. If we ask for <span class="math inline">\(\frac{d\lambda_i }{dt}\)</span>, this implies it is thus equal to <span class="math inline">\(q_i^T \frac{ dS(t)}{dt} q_i.\)</span> So how can we get the gradient <span class="math inline">\(\nabla \lambda_i\)</span> for one of the eigenvalues? Well, firstly, note that <span class="math display">\[\tr (q_i q_i^T)^T dS) = d\lambda_i \implies \nabla \lambda_i = q_i q_i^T.\]</span></p>
<p>What about the eigenvectors? Those come from off diagonal elements, where for <span class="math inline">\(i \neq j,\)</span> <span class="math display">\[(Q^T dS \, Q)_{ij} = \left(Q^T \frac{dQ}{
dt}\right)_{ij} (\lambda_j - \lambda_i).\]</span> Therefore, we can form the elements of <span class="math inline">\(Q^T \frac{dQ}{ dt}\)</span>, and left multiply by <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> to obtain <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dQ}{dt}\)</span> (as <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is orthogonal).</p>
<p>It is interesting to get the second derivative of eigenvalues when moving along a line in symmetric matrix space. For simplicity, suppose <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> is diagonal and <span class="math inline">\(S(t) = \Lambda + t E.\)</span> Therefore, differentiating <span class="math display">\[\frac{d\Lambda}{dt} = \operatorname{diag}\left(Q^T \frac{dS(t)}{dt} Q\right),\]</span> we get <span class="math display">\[\frac{d^2 \Lambda}{dt^2} = \operatorname{diag}\left(Q^T \frac{d^2 S(t)}{dt^2} Q\right) + 2 \operatorname{diag}\left(Q^T \frac{dS(t)}{dt} \frac{dQ}{dt}\right).\]</span> Evaluating this at <span class="math inline">\(Q = I\)</span> and recognizing the first term is zero as we are on a line, we have that <span class="math display">\[\frac{d^2 \Lambda}{dt^2} = 2 \operatorname{diag}\left(E \cdot  \frac{dQ}{dt}\right),\]</span> or <span class="math display">\[\frac{d^2 \Lambda}{dt^2} = 2 \sum_{k \neq i} E_{ik}^2/(\lambda_i - \lambda_k).\]</span> Using this, we can write out the eigenvalues as a Taylor series: <span class="math display">\[\lambda_i (\epsilon) = \lambda_i + \epsilon E_{ii} + \epsilon^2 \sum_{k \neq i} E_{ik}^2/(\lambda_i - \lambda_k) + \dots.\]</span> (In physics, this is known as second-order eigenvalue perturbation theory.)</p>

<h1>Where We Go From Here</h1>
<p>There are many topics that we did not have time to cover, even in 16 hours of lectures. If you came into this class thinking that taking derivatives is easy and you already learned everything there is to know about it in first-year calculus, hopefully we’ve convinced you that it is an enormously rich subject that is impossible to exhaust in a single course. Some of the things it might have been nice to include are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When automatic differentiation (AD) hits something it cannot handle, you may have to write a custom Jacobian–vector product (a “Jvp,” “frule,” or “pushforward”) in forward-mode, and/or a custon row vector–Jacobian product (a “vJp,” “rrule,” “pullback,” or “Jacobian<span class="math inline">\(^T\)</span>-vector product”) in reverse-mode. In Julia with Zygote AD, this is done using <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ChainRulesCore.jl">the ChainRules packages</a>. In Python with JAX, this is done with <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.custom_jvp.html">jax.custon_jvp</a> and/or <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.custom_vjp.html">jax.custon_vjp</a> respectively. In principle, this is straightforward, but the APIs can take some getting used to because the of the generality that they support.</p></li>
<li><p>For functions <span class="math inline">\(f(z)\)</span> with complex arguments <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> (i.e.&nbsp;complex vector spaces), you cannot take “ordinary” complex derivatives whenever the function involves the conjugate <span class="math inline">\(\overline{z}\)</span>, for example, <span class="math inline">\(|z|, \Re(z),\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Im(z)\)</span>. This <em>must</em> occur if <span class="math inline">\(f(z)\)</span> is purely real-valued and not constant, as in optimization problems involving complex-number calculations. One option is to write <span class="math inline">\(z = x+iy\)</span> and treat <span class="math inline">\(f(z)\)</span> as a two-argument function <span class="math inline">\(f(x,y)\)</span> with real derivatives, but this can be awkward if your problem is “naturally” expressed in terms of complex variables (for instance, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_domain">Fourier frequency domain</a>). A common alternative is the “CR calculus” (or “Wirtinger calculus”), in which you write <span class="math display">\[df = \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\right) dz + \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial \overline{z}}\right)d\overline{z},\]</span> as if <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\overline{z}\)</span> were independent variables. This can be extended to gradients, Jacobians, steepest-descent, and Newton iterations, for example. A nice review of this concept can be found in these <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0906.4835">UCSD course notes</a> by K. Kreuz Delgado.</p></li>
<li><p>Many, many more derivative results for matrix functions and factorizations can be found in the literature, some of them quite tricky to derive. For example, a number of references are listed in this <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ChainRules.jl/issues/117">GitHub issue for the ChainRules package</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Another important generalization of differential calculus is to derivatives on curved manifolds and differential geometry, leading to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_derivative">exterior derivative</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>When differentiating eigenvalues <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> of matrices <span class="math inline">\(A(x)\)</span>, a complication arises at eigenvalue crossings (where multiplicity <span class="math inline">\(k&gt;1\)</span>). Here, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors usually cease to be differentiable. More generally, this problem arises for any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_function">implicit function</a> with a repeated root. In this case, one option is use an expanded definition of sensitivity analysis called a <strong>generalized gradient</strong> (a <span class="math inline">\(k\times k\)</span> matrix-valued linear operator <span class="math inline">\(G(x) [dx]\)</span> whose <em>eigenvalues</em> are the perturbations <span class="math inline">\(d\lambda\)</span>. See for example <a href="https://doi.org/10.1006/jfan.1995.1117">Cox (1995)</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01742705">Seyranian <em>et al.</em> (1994)</a>, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.laa.2022.04.019">Stechlinski (2022)</a>. Physicistss call a related idea “degenerate perturbation theory.” A recent formulation of similar ideas is called the <strong>lexicographic directional derivative</strong>. See for example <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10107-005-0633-0">Nesterov (2005)</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10556788.2017.1374385">Barton <em>et al.</em> (2017)</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes, optimization problems involving eigenvalues can be reformulated to avoid this difficulty by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semidefinite_programming">SDP constraints</a>. See for example <a href="http://doi.org/10.1364/OE.22.022632">Men <em>et al.</em> (2014)</a>.</p>
<p>For a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defective_matrix">defective matrix</a> the situation is worse: even the generalized derivatives blow up because <span class="math inline">\(d\lambda\)</span> can be proportional to (e.g.) the square root of the perturbation <span class="math inline">\(\lVert dA\rVert\)</span> (for an eigenvalue with algebraic multiplicity <span class="math inline">\(=2\)</span> and geometric multiplicity <span class="math inline">\(=1\)</span>).</p></li>
<li><p>Famous generalizations of differentation are the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributional_derivative">distributional</a>” and “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_derivative">weak</a>” derivatives. For example, to obtain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function">Dirac delta “functions”</a> by differentiating discontinuities. This requires changing not only the definition of “derivative,” but also changing the definition of <em>function</em>, as reviewed at an elementary level in these <a href="https://math.mit.edu/~stevenj/18.303/delta-notes.pdf">MIT course notes</a>.</p></li>

<li id="fn1"><p>Briefly, a function <span class="math inline">\(g(\delta x)\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(o(\delta x)\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(\lim_{\delta x \to 0} \frac{\Vert g(\delta x) \Vert}{\Vert \delta x \Vert} = 0\)</span>. We will return to this subject in Section&nbsp;<a href="#sec:banach" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:banach">5.2</a>.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Informally, one can think of the vector space of infinitesimals <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> as living in the same space as <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (understood as a small change in a vector, but still a vector nonetheless). Formally, one can define a distinct “vector space of infinitesimals” in various ways, e.g.&nbsp;as a cotangent space in differential geometry, though we won’t go into more detail here.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>In some Julia AD software, this is done with by defining a <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ChainRulesCore.jl">“ChainRule”</a>, and in Python autograd/JAX it is done by defining a custom “vJp” (row-vector—Jacobian product) and/or “Jvp” (Jacobian–vector product).<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>The concept of a “row vector” can be formalized as something called a “covector,” a “dual vector,” or an element of a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_space">dual space</a>,” not to be confused with the <em>dual numbers</em> used in automatic differentiation (Sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:AD" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:AD">8</a>).<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>Some authors distinguish the “dot product” from an “inner product” for complex vector spaces, saying that a dot product has no complex conjugation <span class="math inline">\(x \cdot y = y \cdot x\)</span> (in which case <span class="math inline">\(x \cdot x\)</span> need not be real and does not equal <span class="math inline">\(\Vert x \Vert^2\)</span>), whereas the inner product must be conjugate-symmetric, via <span class="math inline">\(\langle x, y \rangle = \bar{x} \cdot y\)</span>. Another source of confusion for complex vector spaces is that some fields of mathematics define <span class="math inline">\(\langle x, y \rangle = x \cdot \bar{y}\)</span>, i.e.&nbsp;they conjugate the <em>right</em> argument instead of the left (so that it is linear in the left argument and conjugate-linear in the right argument). Aren’t you glad we’re sticking with real numbers?<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>Completeness means that any Cauchy sequence of points in the vector space—any sequence of points that gets closer and closer together—has a limit lying within the vector space. This criterion usually holds in practice for vector spaces over real or complex scalars, but can get trickier when talking about vector spaces of functions, since e.g.&nbsp;the limit of a sequence of continuous functions can be a discontinuous function.<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>Proving the triangle inequality for an arbitrary inner product is not so obvious; one uses a result called the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.<a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>In fact, extraordinarily difficult: “NP-complete” <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3114201.3114717">(Naumann, 2006)</a>.<a href="#fnref8" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p><a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/autodiff_cookbook.html">The Autodiff Cookbook</a>, part of the JAX documentation, discusses this algorithm in a section on Hessian–vector products. It notes that one could also interchange the <span class="math inline">\(\partial/\partial \alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\nabla_x\)</span> derivatives and employ reverse-over-forward mode, but suggests that this is less efficient in practice: “because forward-mode has less overhead than reverse-mode, and since the outer differentiation operator here has to differentiate a larger computation than the inner one, keeping forward-mode on the outside works best.” It also presents another alternative: using the identity <span class="math inline">\((\nabla f)'v = \nabla (v^T \nabla f)\)</span>, one can apply reverse-over-reverse mode to take the gradient of <span class="math inline">\(v^T \nabla f\)</span>, but this has even more computational overhead.<a href="#fnref9" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>Of course, the independent variable need not be time, it just needs to be a real scalar. But in a generic context it is convenient to imagine ODE solutions as evolving in time.<a href="#fnref10" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>For example, the second-order ODE <span class="math inline">\(\frac{d^{2}v}{dt^{2}}+\frac{dv}{dt}=h(v,t)\)</span> could be re-written in first-order form by defining <span class="math inline">\(u=\left(\begin{array}{c}
u_{1}\\
u_{2}
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{c}
v\\
dv/dt
\end{array}\right)\)</span>, in which case <span class="math inline">\(du/dt=f(u,t)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(f=\left(\begin{array}{c}
u_{2}\\
h(u_{1},t)-u_{2}
\end{array}\right)\)</span>.<a href="#fnref11" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>For a modern and full-featured example, see the DifferentialEquations.jl suite of ODE solvers in the Julia language.<a href="#fnref12" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p>This “left-to-right” picture can be made very explicit if we imagine discretizing the ODE into a recurrence, e.g.&nbsp;via Euler’s method for an arbitrarily small <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span>, as described in the MIT course notes <em><a href="https://math.mit.edu/~stevenj/18.336/recurrence2.pdf">Adjoint methods and sensitivity analysis for recurrence relations</a></em> by S.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;Johnson (2011).<a href="#fnref13" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn14"><p>Being fully mathematically rigorous with vector spaces of functions requires a lot of tedious care in specifying a well-behaved set of functions, inserting annoying caveats about functions that differ only at isolated points, and so forth. In this lecture, we will mostly ignore such technicalities—we will implicitly assume that our functions are integrable, differentiable, etcetera, as needed. The subject of <em>functional analysis</em> exists to treat such matters with more care.<a href="#fnref14" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn15"><p>Technically, it only needs to be small “almost everywhere” since jumps that occur only at isolated points don’t affect the integral.<a href="#fnref15" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn16"><p>For more discussion of these concepts, see (e.g.) the review article “Monte Carlo gradient estimation in machine learning” (2020) by Mohamed <em>et al.</em> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10652" class="uri">https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10652</a>).<a href="#fnref16" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn17"><p>Most computer hardware cannot generate numbers that are actually random, only numbers that <em>seem</em> random, called “pseudo-random” numbers. The design of these random-seeming numeric sequences is a subtle subject, steeped in number theory, with a long history of mistakes. A famous ironic quotation in this field is (Robert Coveyou, 1970): “Random number generation is too important to be left to chance.”<a href="#fnref17" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn18"><p>Much of machine learning uses only variations on gradient descent, without incorporating Hessian information except implicitly via “momentum” terms. Partly this can be explained by the fact that optimization problems in ML are typically solved only to low accuracy, often have nonsmooth/stochastic aspects, rarely involve nonlinear constraints, and are often very high-dimensional. This is only a small corner of the wider universe of computational optimization!<a href="#fnref18" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn19"><p>The term “programming” in optimization theory does not refer to software engineering, but is rather an anachronistic term for optimization problems. For example, “linear programming” (LP) refers to optimizing affine objectives and affine constraints, while “quadratic programming” (QP) refers to optimizing convex quadratic objectives with affine constraints. {% endraw %}<a href="#fnref19" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
